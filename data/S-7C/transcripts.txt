0 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  actually, I did surprisingly well./ -cause -s in the past: I haven't done so well./ but this time, actually, I sort of came through./ um / it was close to excellent./ it was good but -/ <BN> <BR> <BR> <SN> well, growing up in New Hampshire there's a a lot of athletic kind of things./ like, I did three sports in high school and, um, didn't really continue here./ but I continued to work out and started to do yoga and things like that./ and so I think pretty much all of the experience I've had doing hand eye coordination interactive things helped me./ <BR> field hockey, swimming, well, and cross country./ and then just hurdles in the f- spring./ <BR> <BR> generally, yeah./ yeah./ actually, I went to quite a few as a kid, traveling through New Hampshire./ there's a lot of different carnival kind of things where you do the ring toss./ and you win a big clown or a big dog or whatever else you want to take home./ <BR>yeah, actually, I usually won pretty much every time./ like, my friends would ask me to throw things./ <LG> they didn't want to -cause pretty much I'd hit it -bout every time./ well, not every time./ but you know you get, like, five chances to win./ and then, you know, when you're little kids you have, like, five dollars./ and so you get, like, you know ten other chances./ and then if you win three out of ten, you know, you get a comb./ and then if you win four out of ten you get, I don't know, like, a -/ some kind of pen knife./ and then if you win eight out of ten you actually get a stuffed animal./ sort of the building prizes./ um <BR> / I gave away a lot of them./ but I had a bunch of them on my bed, like twenty five, thirty, -cause usually there's three or four per year./ <BR> <SN> <BR> <BR> yeah <BR> ./ but I think especially as little kids they want you coming back for all the money./ and I wouldn't be the one buying the tickets all the time./ it would be other <BR> little kids./ <BR> <BN> <BR> <BR> <BR> um / probably./ but I think it probably had more to do with growing up in a competitive household and family environment./ i- everyone was pretty active in, like, sports or things like that./ and: it just sort of generated this competitive atmosphere in terms of, you know, well, I can climb this tree./ w-/ <ASP> I can climb this tree./ it's higher than that tree./ and, you know, <BR> in terms of everything you did was sort of oneupmanship in this competition./ so I think that probably had more of an impact than anything else./ <BR> <BR> uh: / well, they'd probably say I was pretty good, -cause -/ although all of them are pretty poorly coordinated./ so / in a comparative kind of sense./ but, I mean, I definitely -/ if you asked the people I played with in high school, you know, whether I could get the goal from the corner then, yeah, I could do that./ <BR> <BR> <BR> um / they'd actually say pretty good./ <LG> um -s -/ in terms of just giving me directions and leading my friends around the city I generally tend to do that./ <BR> <BR> <BR> um / no, I don't think I have./ <BR> <BR> yeah./ <BR> <BN> <BR> oh, yeah./ <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> well, initially I thought maybe I wouldn't do so well./ just -cause it's the morning./ I barely woke up./ I haven't had all my coffee yet./ so for me sometimes I'm not so awake in the morning./ but, you know, once I'm actually awake -/ and I only had four hours of sleep last night./ so / put that all together, and that can cause some, you know, sort of uncoordinated effect./ <BR> um / it was good./ it was close to excellent, but it was good./ <BR>
1 T/E:MUSICAL   mhm./ <BR> um, actually I did well./ I did good./ <BR> <BR> <BR> <SN> um / <UNIN> I think some of it was just song recognition./ I think./ I d- -ctually did chorus in high school./ so I suppose that that probably helped./ although I haven't done anything since I've been at college./ <BR> <BR> uh / no, not now./ when I was young I played the violin for about eight years and the piano for a few./ but then I sort of let that fall off./ -cause it's not so easy to cart around a piano or get hours in the rooms here./ <BR> <SN> no./ it was just my mom taught me -cause she did private lessons./ so I guess technically yes, I took private lessons, but it was from my mom./ <BR> <BR> yeah./ um: / actually, it was last night./ my boyfriend asked me./ um / actually, <LG> it's a probably group you won't know, Rasputaina./ <LG> no./ and uh / it was Transylvanian Concubine./ and I'm guessing you probably don't know that either./ no./ <BR> uh / that did pretty well./ he enjoyed it./ yeah, it was on this screen while it was going along./ <BR> <BR> no./ <LG> no, I really don't./ <BR> well, for the most part they were sort of childhood rhyme kind of songs./ except for the Star Spangled Banner, which, growing up in New Hampshire, you have to sing that every day./ and in:, you know, assemblies./ and there's vets and all of that./ so that one I was quite familiar with./ <BR> yeah./ yeah, I'd say I do./ <BR> uh / they'd think I'd do pretty well./ I mean, obviously the one- -/ I have some friends who majored in music and thought I sang pretty well./ um: / so, I mean, when I was with all the music majors they wouldn't expect me to sing, like, the Happy Birthday song or something like that./ um / but with non music majors I think I'd be considered good./ like, my boyfriend started up a little band thing./ I kind of sang lead for a little bit./ and it was very much just kind of in dingy clubs, not really doing much./ but I did sing./ <BR> well, I just sang./ I didn't play any kind of instrument./ although he did try and teach me guitar, -n- my fingers didn't actually take to it too well./ <BR> um, Bellevue./ I don't know if you know that./ it's actually the same name, yes, I know. as the mental hospital<LG>./ <LG> um / but they have, like, a little stage in the back -bout every Wednesday for a while./ uh / they had performances, and: some of them were pretty bad./ but our- ours got a pretty good reception./
2 LD/HE:SURVIVAL   mhm./ not so great<LG>./ like very poor./ <LG> well, despite growing up in New Hampshire I didn't really go out camping or hiking that much./ I mean, yes, there's the whole competitive sports interactive part./ but I didn't really go for the whole survival thing in terms of going out and doing a survivalist experience./ <LG> -cause a lot of people did decide to do those kinds of things where you get dropped off in a remote area and, you know, you get specific amounts of things./ like, you get some dryer lint, um, batteries and some other things./ and you have to try and stay there for a week and survive and eat snails or whatever else you find and start your fire and that kind of thing./ <LG> and that sort of just didn't appeal to me./ <LG> so I never really went on those./ so I never really got that kind of information./ <BR> <BR> a couple times growing up in New Hampshire, but I was usually the one -/ I'd kind of, like, lag along and not really know what to do if someone -/ if someone broke their ankle./ I'd have no idea what to do./ <LG> I don't think so./ I mean<LG>, if there's no one else around I suppose I could./ -cause I guess that's better than dying./ <LG> but I don't know that I'd be a lot better than that./ <BR> no, I'd probably call for someone else./ <BR> um: / I don't know./ I guess I kind of vaguely remember C.P.R. pictures from restaurant kind of walls where, you know, in case someone has a heart attack./ and I could try and do<LG> some of that./ but I don't really remember it all that well./ <BR> um: / <BR> <SN> -t me see./ I guess, I think -/ what is it called?/ the Heimlich Maneuver, I think./ um / I guess I suppose I could try that w- -/ it's when you put your arms around someone, I think, and: -/ <UNIN> -cause it's usually -/ you're pressing on their stomach./ and you want to create pressure./ so / right here actually, I think./ either that or maybe if you do sort of pound someone on the back kind of a thing./ <BR> <BR> yes, unfortunately./ <LG> well, my family did the two extremes./ they'd go camping in the woods./ and I would do everything I could to get out of it./ because I didn't really want to go and most of the time I could get out after just a day hike./ but then sometimes they decided to do, like -/ rent the whole camper thing and spend a weekend drinking bud lite, which was not really my scene either./ and so I think for the most part I tried to stay at friends' houses at that point in time and have significant school projects that were due./ <BR> no./ that's why I moved away from New Hampshire to New York./ <BR> <BR> <BR> uh / they'd tell you I really did not like it./ <BR> they would definitely tell you that./ <BR> s- fa- -/ I came to New York in ninety seven, and then it was a few years before that, so ninety w- four, maybe./ <BR>

4 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY   mhm./ uh / actually, I did well./ excellent./ uh / again, I think it's because I took a couple of years off and spent some time -/ I worked at a dot com as a programmer, and then, you know, I had some time going around New York, seeing New York./ I worked at a company down by Madison Square Garden area./ so I kind of got to know more downtown than I would normally living up here./ <BR> <BR> no, I haven't really./ some time in Brooklyn./ kind of in the Williamsburg area./ but / other than that, a little bit of time in Astoria to going to vi-<MP> visit Greek relatives./ not significant time./ <BR> um / w- -/ I took the, uh, N.R. before./ but I think those lines have all changed, so I'm not sure what I would take now since I haven't been there in a bit./ <BR> <BR> uh / with<MP> my friends./ we had to take the L to the G, which was really kind of a pain -cause we were coming from the upper west side./ <BR> <BR> um / spent a bit with one of my friends who lived, like, in the financial district area./ but / uh, at that point I usually let him take the lead a bit./ although I did get to know the area./ one of my favorite restaurants down in that area is a restaurant called Vietnam./ if you ever go down there you should try it./ <BR> yeah some of my friends were there so I spent some time there./ um / not a whole lot, though./ I mean I kind of know my way around the area./ <BR> <BR> yeah I do and, actually<LG>, usually friends come and visit and I end up being the one having to show people around the city./ and end up leading us, feeling like a tour group leader, leading people around, sort of telling them here are the sights, let's go to this one next, the empire state building./ you know./ depending on who they are I sort of vary it./ <BR> hm./ <BR> I don't know./ it hasn't been for a while./ um: / <BR> where was it?/ oh, yeah./ it was in Brooklyn./ I was trying to find my friend's apartment./ this was a while ago./ it was in -/ where was it?/ it was like the edge of Bushwick, one of those new, well, becoming artsy but not really artsy yet neighborhoods./ and they had a studio there./ I was trying to find them, never been in the area before./ so i don't know Bushwick, Brooklyn very well./
5 LD/E:CIVICS   not so well./ <LG> I d- poor./ <LG> well, I don't really have too much of an interest in the area./ and outside of something that's sort of headline screaming news I don't really pay attention to it./ <SN> no./ what news I ge- get usually get from online, and it's usually specific things I'm interested in, like, you know, specific English conferences coming up or things to do with that or different tech news./ <BR>  oh<~> / more than fifteen minutes./ I don't know<~>./ couple of -/ year and a half maybe./ <BR> <BR> no./ actually, most of my friends and I don't even buy newspapers./ what little news we do read we just get online./ <BR> <BR> no./ they'd sort of consider<MP> it par for the course./ <BR> not particularly./ not particularly, no,.
