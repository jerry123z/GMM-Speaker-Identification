0 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  actually i did surprisingly well because  in the past i haven't done so  but this time  actually i sort of came through  um it was close second one was good but  mhm  mhm  yeah  well growing up in new hampshire there's uh  a lot of athletic kind of things like i did three sports in high school and um  didn't really continue here but i continue to work out and started to do yoga and things like that and so  i think pretty much all the experience i've had doing hand eye coordination interactive things helps me  field hockey swimming well in cross country  and then just turtles spring  mhm  oh yeah  yeah actually i went to quite a few of the kid travelling through new hampshire there's a lot of different  carnivals kind of things where you do the ring toss and you win a big clown or a big dog or whatever else you want to take home  [noise] yeah actually i usually one pretty much every time like  my friend had asked me a throw things  they didn't want to <unk>  pretty much i hit it  but every time  well not every time but you know you get like five chances to win  and then you know when you're little kids you have like five dollars and  so you get like ten other chances and then if you went three out of ten  you know you get home and then if you were four of ten you get i don't know like some kind of pen knife and if he went eight out of ten you actually get a stuffed animal served a building prizes  um i gave him a lot of 'em but i had a bunch of my bed like  twenty five thirty it's usually there's three or four per year  mhm  mhm  mhm  right  yeah  but i think especially as little kids they want you coming back for  all the money and i wouldn't be the one buying the tickets all the time of the other  mhm  little kids  mhm  yeah  mhm  yeah  mhm  probably but i think it probably had more to do with growing up in a competitive household and family environment  everyone is pretty active um like sports or things like that and it just sort of generated competitive atmosphere in terms of you know well i can climb the streets well i can climb the street it's higher than that tree  yeah you know  in terms of everything you did it sort of one upmanship in this kind of competition so i think that probably had more of an impact or anything else  and uh  mhm  um well i say i was pretty good 'cause although all of them are pretty poorly coordinated  [noise] so  nick comparative kind of sense but i mean i definitely if you ask the people i played with in high school  you know whether i should get  the goal from  the corner then yeah i could do that  yeah  right  mhm  they actually say pretty good  um in terms of just giving me directions and meeting my friends around the city i generally tend to do that  mhm  mhm  mhm  um no i don't think i have  mhm  mhm  yeah  mhm mhm mhm mhm  right  oh yeah  mhm  uh-huh  no but it is  right  well initially  i thought  maybe i wouldn't do so well  just because it's the morning i barely woke up i haven't had all my coffee yet  so for me  sometimes i'm not so wake in the morning  but you know once i'm actually waiting they only had four hours of sleep last night so  put that altogether knocking post something  yeah sort of uncoordinated effect  mhm  um it's good it was close to <unk> good  yeah 
1 T/E:MUSICAL  mhm mhm  um actually i did well good  mhm  mhm  yeah  [laughter]  um often i think some of it was just falling recognition  i think  i actually did course in high school so i suppose  that that probably helped although i haven't done anything since i've been in college  mhm  mhm  uh no not now when i was young i played the violin for about eight years and  the piano for a few but then i sort of what that fall off  it's not too easy a cart around a piano or get hours and the rooms here  yeah mhm  no it's just my mom taught me 'cause she did private lessons so i guess  technically if they took private lessons the rest of my mom  mhm  mhm  yeah  um actually it's last night my boyfriend after me  um actually  it's a probably a group you won't know raspy tina  yeah  and uh it was transformation concubine  and i'm guessing you probably don't know that either  uh-huh  yeah  oh that's a pretty well  enjoyed it  no it was on the screen what was going along  do you listen to  right  no [laughter]  no i really don't  mhm  well for the most part they were sort of childhood rhyme kind of songs  except for the star spangled banner which  growing up in new hampshire you'd have to think that every day and  in you know assemblies and there's that's and all that so  that when i was quite familiar with  mhm  yeah  yes i do  i told one of your friends and um  um they think i would do pretty well i mean  obviously the one i have some friends who major to music and thought i think pretty well  uh-huh  so i mean when i was with all the music majors they wouldn't expect me to sing the happy birthday song or something like that  [noise] um  but with non music majors i think i'd be considered  good  [noise] like my boyfriend start up a little band saying i kind of thing lead for a little bit  yeah it's very much just kind of  <unk> clubs not really doing much but  i did something  mhm  well i just saying i didn't play  any kind of instrument although i did try to teach me guitar and  my fingers and actually take to it too well  [noise] so we're  um <unk> i don't know if you know that it's actually the same name yes i know it's the mental hospital [laughter]  um  but they have like a little stage in the back but every wednesday for a while  uh they had performances  and  we're pretty bad but i got a pretty good reception 
2 LD/HE:SURVIVAL  mhm  not so great [laughter]  like very poor [laughter]  well like growing up in new hampshire i didn't really go out camping or hiking that much  yes it is the whole competitive sports interactive part but  i didn't really go for the whole survival things in terms of going out doing  a survivalist experience [laughter] 'cause a lot of people did decide to do those kinds of things where you get  dropped off in uh  remote area and you know you get  specific amounts of things like you get some drier went um  batteries and some other things and you have to try and stay there for a week and survive and  eat snails or whatever else you find and start your fire and that kind of thing and that sort of just didn't appeal to me  so i never really went out and it was so i'd never really got that kind of information  yeah  mhm  oh couple of times grandpa new hampshire but  i was usually the one are kind of like  flag along  yeah not really  no it to someone  so <unk> i have no idea what to do  i don't think so i mean  if there is no one else around i suppose i could 'cause i guess it's better than dying [laughter] but i don't know that i'd be a lot better than that  if i were to  no i probably call for someone else  [noise] [noise]  um i don't know i guess i kind of vaguely remember c._p._r. pictures from  restaurant kind of  waltz where you know in case someone has a heart attack and  to try and do some of that but i don't really remember at all that well  yeah  uh-huh  mhm  mhm you see  i guess i think what is it called the  hi i'm like i say [laughter]  um [noise]  i guess i suppose i could try that  so you put your arms around someone i think and  is it 'cause it's usually your friend again  do you want to create pressure so  right cures i think  either that or maybe you do for a pound someone on the <unk> kind of a thing  so as far as  mhm  yes unfortunately [laughter]  well my family did  the two extremes they'd go camping in the woods and i would do everything i could to get out of it because i didn't really want to go  yeah  most of the time i could get out after just a day hike  but then  sometimes they decide to do like rent the whole <unk> thing and spend the weekend drinking like which was not really my thing either  and  so i think for the most part i tried to stay at friend's houses at that point in time and have significant school projects that were do  mhm  <unk> that's why i moved away from the answer to new york  [noise]  mhm  mhm  uh they tell you i really did not like it [noise] they definitely tell you that  mhm  yeah  i came to new york in ninety seven and i went to a few years before that so  ninety  four maybe  mhm 
3 T/H:FOODWINE  um i actually did pretty well  um  second  mhm  mhm  sorry  so i did  pretty good  yes  mhm  um  well i think  i took a couple of years off and so i had some time sort of  in the real world eating outside of a dorm and so i could tell the wine glasses of it  i could  yeah  <unk> this rhyme that my mom taught me as a kid so  mhm  for that kind of thing i guess it's just a bit of experience in the field  yeah  yes  um fare amount not as much as some of my friends um  because they used to drag me along too  they're dinners because one of them worked for an architect and she loved wind didn't really have much else to do mostly veterans office anyway except uh  every night around you know four o'clock because that was about time start drinking  mhm  he wanted people to come over and coming joy it's fine with him and  pretty much what i learned i learned from him  and you would go off on which ones are sweet and which ones were  uh you know double barrel fermented  [noise] i spent some time kind of learning some things about that ah obviously i'm not an expert or anything like  that but i think compared to sort of like a lemon i have a pretty good knowledge  mhm  um lately i've been into the <unk> it's an italian read  sort of earthy  i don't know if you enjoy that kinda thing  yeah  right  oh actually i have a wide pallet i like  [laughter]  everything the side of  dog and <unk>  [laughter]  yeah we're <unk>  mhm  um <unk>  you know that is or  i was actually a very good  been waiting for a while like one of our friends got us in  mhm  i had the <unk>  it was  surprisingly good like i i sort of ended up trying that 'cause i  it was on the edge of what i might or might not like  mhm  um we had was an italian i notice a <unk>  and i'm real though it was something more  i go a little bit better  what sort of a <unk> sort of taste  yeah i remember though  oh yeah remember enjoying it  <unk> and a couple of people and  turn on the far into the booth  sarah necessarily remember seeing the line  in the bottle  i like cooking  [laughter]  it's like sometimes it just helps me relax  i enjoy baking i think more than cooking  um  and i think it's a little bit <unk> very specificity involved and baking once you have the right ratios  you can sort of start to play with it  mhm  i myself and in the mood for um  lately i've been in the mood for curry seven making the italian we not time [laughter]  uh tie curry with  this <unk> salmon i guess  i said time 'cause i was thinking about it but also um is a couple of different recipes i adopted myself  uh specific ways of grilling the salmon and whatnot and then actually during the curry in the rye some sort of combine it all  <unk>  um  was it  you'll suitcase 
4 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY  mhm  oh actually i did well excellent  ah again i think it's because i took a couple of years off  yeah and spent some time i worked at a dot com it's a programmer  and then  some time going around new york city new york i worked at a company down by madison square garden area so i kind of got to know  more downtown that i wouldn't normally living up here  [laughter]  mhm  [noise] no i haven't really sometime in brooklyn  kind of in the williamsburg area  right  other than that a little bit of time in a story that you're going to be visit greek relatives but  not significant time  mhm  um well i took the area and our before but i think those lines of all change so i'm not sure what our take now haven't been there in a bit  mhm  mhm  and it's nice  we had to take the l. to the g.  actually  really kind of a pain 'cause you're coming from the upper west side  yeah mhm  mhm  that was one of my friends who live like in the financial district area  right  uh at that point  i usually let him take the lead a bit although i do get to know the area  one of my favorite restaurants down that area's restaurant called vietnam do you ever go down there you should try it  mhm  some of my friends are there so i spent some time they're not a whole lot though  i mean i kind of know my way around the area  [noise] yeah  oh sure  yeah i do  and actually [laughter]  usually friends come and visit and i ended up being the one having to show people around the city  and <unk> feeling like a tour group leader leaving people around  yes  telling them feared the sights let's go to this one next the empire state building  yeah  depending on who they are <unk>  mhm  mhm  i don't know i haven't been for a while  um  where was it  oh yes in brooklyn i was trying to find my friend's apartment this was a while ago  it was in  where was it was like  the edge of bush rent one of those new  well  becoming artsy but not really <unk> neighborhoods native studio they're trying to find them never been in the area before  so i don't know bush what brooklyn very well 
5 LD/E:CIVICS  not so well [laughter]  poor [laughter]  well i don't really have too much of an interest in the area and outside of something looks sort of  headlines screaming news i don't really pay attention to it  mhm  no what news i get i usually get from on line and it's usually specific things i'm interested in like  you know specific enlist conferences coming up or things that are different tech news  mm mm  oh more than fifteen minutes i don't know  couple of  year and a half maybe  yeah  mhm  no actually most of my friends and i don't even buy newspapers what little news we do we just get on line  mhm  mhm  yeah  they'd serve <unk>  par for the course  mhm  not particularly  not particularly no  i mean  not something that interests me  if i happen to go on a website with that and evidently get on some link to attack site and i go read things there  not very interesting the current events  hey  hi i'm [laughter] no  yeah  uh no i took the one required civics course i had first semester like freshman year which is six years ago now lives  little to know memory of it  mhm  well you had to take one semester of physics at any point in time i took my freshman year to get it out of the weight  i didn't want to humor i hadn't i didn't want to think about it anymore  [laughter]  in my high school or you know it's just the one freshmen course that i took  um there's one but i took the one that was  blended american history and english because i had skipped one of the year so i got to skip out on some of those  the history curriculum  well skip the english years and then  this one was that combine class so i got to take the combine class which  history professor well teacher  wasn't particularly interesting teaching history  and the woman is teaching english pretty much  ran the class and so it was mostly english was little bit of history  yes  mhm  um let me think i don't know what isn't my english teacher my math teacher i think  oh definitely definitely not [laughter]  mhm  and uh  [noise] how did you do in  um oh yeah right 'cause i could memorize of things but then i <unk> pretty much promptly forgot about it 'cause i sort of had this ongoing  goal that i wanted to go to college i knew to go to a big <unk> had to get good grades so suck it up my freshman year and then forget about it  yeah  mhm  parents  mhm  yes  mhm  um no i don't i'm still registered new hampshire for text reasons  uh-huh  and so i could directly have voted in new hampshire elections except i haven't bothered to do so  i think it was the last presidential race  mhm  um they do yeah 'cause it came in the mail  it came to my barnard mailbox and i just did that  say you know really  no [laughter] actually [laughter]  yeah  not at all  mhm  no not particularly like i mean i guess we had to go to the fifth grade field trip to go  look at it when it came up to new hampshire but  outside of that  didn't really have any interest in the documents self  mhm  maybe in third grade when i was probably sports is hanging on the wall next to me but  do i remember any of it that [laughter]
