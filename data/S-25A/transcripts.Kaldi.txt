0 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  interactive  [noise] i did really really well on that um it wasn't really difficult  just because i've had experience with some <unk> some of the stuff that was asked flow was pretty easy for the most part  [noise] what was my school it was good  [noise] well like i said before i didn't have much difficulty with doing it i mean it was pretty easy for the most part there wasn't really anything that was incredibly hard so  [noise] yeah uh i play mostly basketball although i haven't played in a while but that's the one consistent sport that i have played so  direction following [noise] um [noise] i'm good i wouldn't say an excellent but i'm i'm pretty good at it  [noise] not time no but i've seen it i've seen it enough to be good at it  she would say that sounds just about right  [noise] yeah they do i mean  [noise] i think i'm pretty good listener anyway i mean if you were to talk to most of my friends i think that'd be one of the qualities that they would say about me is that i am a good listener  [noise] i think for the <unk> i think that um  i think they would say that i'm pretty good at it 
1 LD/E:MUSICAL  [noise]  i could do on that  oh it was poor  well i forgot some of the song i mean it's kind of embarrassing some of the songs are actually simple i've heard them before but  i just had a difficult time  remembering some of the words  [noise] no  uh-huh  [laughter] [laughter] have you ever  [laughter] have you ever played an instrument dough [laughter] no no i have it  okay good [laughter]  yep [laughter]  [noise] it was but like i said i don't play an instrument i mean i just grew up listening to a lot of music so  yeah  yeah  nothing  absolutely nothing  lots  [noise] uh mostly everything but country and jazz and classical  so with the exception of  those three things  every other type of  job or pop rock [noise] hip hop r. and b. cetera  on the musical  she would say i would i mean because she's hurt anything you know atrocious i mean i listen to a lot of music but i mean a lotta people listen to a lot of music but they're not good  at singing and so you know  i'm one of those people  [noise]  [noise] oh boy  it's been awhile usually because i sing only to myself [noise] so um i can't remember but if i had to get [noise] may be a couple of weeks ago i want to say i can't really approximate but i want to say i don't know maybe two three weeks ago  [laughter]  um but  whatever i'm listening to at the moment you know if i'm listening to uh  i don't know  [noise] some hip hop and that's what i'll be thinking but mostly uh  you know  sauce  salads are really cheesy stuff like that  [noise] well if you're smart than you know that i'm telling the truth if you're smart i mean because it's pretty clear 
2 T/HE:SURVIVAL  i did good  <unk> yeah  um well i mean a survival stuff  [noise] um  even though i <unk> i've never been particularly like i've never been in those situations i mean when you watch a lot of t._v.  then you kind of get to pick up certain things so i mean i watch like the t._v. and i talk to people who've been in situations like that so with watching t._v. and talking to people like you know i was able to have the knowledge to know  about like different survival skills  and t._v. t._v. is very helpful i mean i watch a good amount of t._v. so  mhm  [noise] well a lot of older people like um [noise] i don't know like family um or most of the time i actually i wouldn't even say family but friends and family 'cause my family has it  been in situations like that but [noise] usually it's you know if i've overheard a conversation um it's not something that um i might pay attention too but  i pick up snippets of things and so i remember it so in this situation i was able to remember some of the things that we would have helped me so  um like for instance with um  [noise]  mhm  [noise] not really sure  it has i mean i'm not really sure it's kinda it's it's been a while  uh i think i've heard  you know so i can't  [noise] i can't really remember right now  [noise] uh probably a couple of months ago that's probably why i don't remember specifically what it is i mean i've heard over and a lot of conversations or pat a lotta conversation so  it's not something that really sticks out to me right now  [noise]  um  [laughter] so  uh i mean i did a lot of camping so growing up so i was able to pick up  and stuff from that  [noise] um  mhm  well when i went  to uh i went to russia two years ago moscow and i worked with orphaned [noise] and we went camping with the orphans and mostly you know so i i've done that and then mostly when i was about maybe ten or eleven around eight to ten eleven twelve i'm twenty two now so it's been years but from the aid for about ten to twelve i did a lot of camping do <unk> after school program had sleep away camp that will go on for about a month like one of the camps was kept mariah carey i don't know if you've ever heard of it it is an actual camp  and i went through it is an actual camp and i went to it when it first [noise] when it first opened up and it's a month and so  you know i was upstate for a month so i did that and then went to or or goes kept that was years ago  but i mean so with i have that experience but that was [noise] a long time ago but i i'm able to remember um some of the things that you know you have to do or whatever and <unk> [noise]  [noise] um well actually you know what i need to backtrack [noise] that i shouldn't i shouldn't include that as a part of the camping because when i went camping we weren't with the orphans um the orphans which somewhere separate wife's by like [laughter] or if it were you don't believe you but i actually do get america um but um  [noise] the or thin [noise]  they have their own place [noise] basically what happened that we stayed camping overnight and then they came to where we were camping and we only stayed there for one night  [noise] so for instance um  in the day we would hang out with them  play games do whatever  um and then at night they would go back to where they were staying and then we would stay at the spot that we were at and that was only for one night but i wouldn't want to include that with my other camping space because i was only there for one night so  [noise] i think the steps that did it earlier on  it's more relevant  [noise] um [noise] a good amount a good amount i wouldn't say inched ordinary about but you know a pretty decent amount  [noise] um i would say so i mean i had i had pretty good training i know what i was when i went to the camps and like age ten to twelve i do remember a session or a couple of sessions where they did show with how to do that stuff so i think i would do pretty well  excellent but i definitely know that i would do well in the i think i could do well enough to help somebody  [noise] uh i have it but you know i watch t._v. um prepared [noise] and i had that experience that that i learned when i was younger so i'm prepared if need be but  i haven't  mhm 
3 LU/H:FOODWINE  i did get with that as well  [noise] well i eat out a lot mhm  [noise] um i don't but i watch a lot of cooking shows like the food network so me and my mother both really into food um [noise] so we we we've watched the the food network my mother does a lot of cooking so i've been able to pick up a lot of things from her  [noise] my mother  uh somewhat  um when i do cook yet [laughter]  i mean that's not very much but when i do  i i mean i haven't got any complaints  [noise] she would say i did get just because i watched her cooking growing up so a lot of the stuff that i do know how to do my own is because of her  my mother  [noise] not excellent good  what  yeah  [noise] um it is it's not the most perfect thing food is [noise] is is more important to me than wine but you know since i eat out a lot i've had wine you know pretty often  [noise] um well i like italian so  that's that's one of my favorite spanish and italian and my favorite types of food 
4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  well uh i'm actually a little embarrassed because [noise]  i did i did pretty poorly on that i mean i'm from new york but um  i wasn't very familiar with some of the stuff i was close but not  [noise] i didn't really get it  poor  well it's early in the morning one for one it's really in the morning and so like the things that i did the poorest on like honestly it's because i'm just not in the right for i'm not used to getting up early in the morning so by mine wasn't exactly all there and i think our brushed and i wasn't really thinking through it because i mean i'm from new york should definitely some of that stuff i i feel like i could have picked up but i wasn't really uh focus [noise]  [noise] well definitely this one definitely this one  uh manhattan upper west side  yes  [noise] um  i don't know i spend most of my time um round the fourteenth street area so  downtown i guess you could say is why spend most of my time  right  [noise] uh not particularly  mhm  um [noise]  uh yes and no  um  i mean like i said i spend most of my time fourteenth street area but i have a lot of friends who are outside of manhattan like in brooklyn so you know if i'm not in manhattan and i might be somewhere like in brooklyn for instance  she would be disappointed because i should know better  [noise] uh no no  [noise]  i'm not sure  there's a lot of things here  and it's a lot of things  to be confused by  because um i've been here all my life but yet  there are parts of the city that i'm not even aware of [noise] so [noise]  i'm not really sure  um  i mean in manhattan they're different things  money money money thing you know <unk> pretty bad you know what i'm trying to things that that stand out which is whatever the statue of liberty to just opened it up so i might recommend that but again i mean i have a difficult time myself navigating certain things you know i mean i can tell you which up and where to go down but  i have  a difficult time finding things myself so  i i'm not really sure i couldn't tell you right now like where would i take someone i'd have to really think about that  [laughter]  [noise] um  [noise]  i have to say maybe about [noise]  a couple of weeks ago i don't remember specifically when  um  [noise]  i'm trying to remember what the situation was i don't remember what the situation was i mean it was something  simple i mean i don't remember what it what it was but  i mean  i don't know  i was by myself  mhm  um i was going to someone's house up town that i wasn't i wasn't familiar with the area  [noise] um like around the washington heights area but  it was like the avenue it's not necessarily the street that i had a problem with but like avenues more so  [noise] just hang on it there of  i mean that's what i that's what i like to do  um i spend most of my time it's been spending most of my time this summer just hanging out with people hanging out with them it watching movies [noise] so i mean that's one of my favorite things to do so we were going to do that  pam  yes yes yes  she uh she and i went [noise] uh to the same college she still goes there i i just graduated  [noise] new school university  [noise] my major was education  mhm  um well i'm a new school and a little bit on traditional so um they don't do we didn't have early childhood so mostly it was um  you know high school sort of thing  but a lot of it was um  more theory than actual practice so 
5 T/E:CIVICS  i didn't do well on that at all i did i did poorly on that  i don't really pay attention to it [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [laughter]  <unk> it's it's  you know even for me too oh i feel i mean so  [laughter] very little very very little  yeah  yeah  most of my classes were  mainly on education and it's um it's a liberal arts school so we did a lot of uh did a lot of education classes and riding horses those were like the two primary thing that i did uh sleep poetry so i do a lot of writing poetry and education classes  [noise] so  [noise] i've read sometimes i mean you saw that i had i brought in a paper today but i'm not a consistent reader  of newspapers  am i registered  yeah  yeah <unk>  [noise] no  you know i'm not really sure  i'm not sure it is a tough it's a tough call  it's it's a debatable thing uh i'm not really educated on on the candidates i mean i know that i don't want to vote for bush but at the same time i don't know a lot about carey so i feel a bit um [noise] i'm in the middle about that  [noise] no  no they don't really pay much attention to it either [laughter] so no but [laughter]  [noise] no  i might is  but i mean i can't remember  i mean i probably did in junior high school or something like that but i'm not really sure i didn't do it in college 
6 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  [noise] i did well  i did i said i did good on that  mhm  yeah  uh-huh  is that right i don't  i mean  actually i told you  i did  [laughter]  [laughter]  [laughter]  [noise] [noise]  [noise] is what's going on  that i'm lying  no i mean  like i told you  i watch a lot of t._v. i listen to a lot of people talk i observe  and so with the combination of those things i was able to do well  and it's not i'm not saying that i would [noise] guilt and all of those things but that doesn't mean i don't know about them  what's that  i did i did 
7 LD/E:MUSICAL  yeah i mean did you hear what i i said  why i didn't  do well  kim  early worthy [laughter] oh no actually did i say that i don't remember but what i did say is that the songs were easy to remember but i still had a difficult time that's what i said  right right  and then i  i changed it back and said that [laughter] but it was it  definitely definitely i don't this is not  [noise] an everyday thing for me to get up at eight something in the morning so  you know  i do have a hard time  having the right frame of mind  in the morning i mean and that's not anything surprising most people have a hard time focusing early in the morning so it's not just about like me [noise] you know  i think that's a pretty normal thing 
8 T/HE:SURVIVAL  [noise] oh i did i did get on that  on the <unk>  i'd say about an eight  [noise] well like i said before with the survival section ah i i don't have first hand experience but because i've watched t._v. or whatever i was able to have the knowledge to know what you would do in those situations but i have not personally been and some of those situations but i have i do have the knowledge either from here from someone who has been through it or watching t._v. i would say that you know that's why i was able to get you know some of those things right because of that so that's why we could myself and eat  but it's true i mean <unk> like it's true you you get to sit here and tell me that you haven't learned something from t._v. or movies like i go to a lot of movies i go to a lot of movies and i watch a lot of t._v. okay i'm not working so  if i'm not hanging out with my friends i'm at home watching tv [noise] so i mean you can take that as you want but the truth is is that i do spend a lot of time watching t._v. and i do see a lot of movies and i do get a lot of my knowledge from that 
9 LU/H:FOODWINE  i did get on that  yeah  [noise] it doesn't bother me because i don't have anything to hide  mhm  mhm  um [noise] i <unk> i said eight again you know i go out a lot i eat a lot okay um  if i had to tell you terms of food and why i know food extremely well  fine um good not excellent but food definitely excellent like i'm really i eat out pretty often i mean especially when i was [noise] when i was in school i was primarily eating out and i don't do a lot of cooking so i mean i'm still at home my mom cooks but i don't cook so i'm out late hours 
10 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  i did poor  where uh which is you why did you figure that out  [noise] i don't know i mean i told you my reason for  for not doing better on it  i mean i don't really know what else to tell you beyond that i know that i could have done better but i just did it  well i mean the most obvious reason is that i'm from new york  that's the most obvious reason and that's why you know i know i could have done better but the reality is that i didn't  um i mean  that's the reality of it  i'm from new york  yeah  there are there are things that i know and there are things that i don't know and it just so happened that the things that she was asking  i did not know or i didn't really think too because i definitely know there was some answers that  when she told me the answer i said the wrong answer and then she told me to answer i knew what it was but i rushed through it or [noise] i didn't know say for instance like uh  a particular avenue or the exact street you know [noise] so i mean in some situations i was definitely close but i think with some of the answers i rushed them 
11 T/E:CIVICS  that's what i said  yes  um what was it two thousand yeah  yeah  [noise] i don't know honestly i don't know i mean it's really going to come to [laughter] where do you decide to believe me or not [noise] i'm telling you what i know um and that's all i can really do  you know i mean  i don't i'm i'm really not honestly i'm really really not sure if i'm gonna vote um  this time around so  you know i mean it's not and i don't [noise] i mean i watch t._v. but  you know and i read the newspaper sometimes but  you know politics is really not  it's not  as important to me is i don't know like music would be er  you know what i'm saying listening to music or going to movies you know like those are my hobbies i mean i like to read but i don't like to read political things per se  mhm  say that again i'm sorry can be  mhm  [noise] right right right  right right  i mean i'm not  [noise] i mean if you get out and just in new school is broken up and did many different parts [noise] okay so  wow the new school in of itself the new school at school right it's a separate school it's very political this particular school that i went to  i mean it's so so  you know what i'm saying so like if you understand  the history of the news when you understand different parts of it [noise] the personality of the schools are different even though the news was a whole political the personality of it is different i mean [noise] so  you know what i'm saying like i was  you know i went to a school that was my uh particular undergraduate school eugene laying um  it has uh  pretty decent you know reputation for being political but more so the new school uh you know which people go to that is really the the school that has recognized as being the most quote unquote political but if you want to look at my school specifically the school i went to  that's not really the case so  <unk> does that make sense  okay
