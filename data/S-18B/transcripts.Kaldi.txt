6 T/H:INTERACTIVE  [noise] interactive um see that was the <unk> really bad  [laughter]  well  um  it's more like a lot of writing i have to do a lot of writing  and  it's more project base and it's more focusing on one specific project  working with one  area and doing a lot of writing and reporting related to that  so i don't really have to um  and i also pretty much run my own  like section of work so i don't really have someone above me  mandating what i do  and uh  mhm  we're not  like that no [laughter]  maybe my shoe or something but you know  for  mhm  they said soccer  they really would
