9 LU/H:FOODWINE  yeah  oh sorry  um  not really  i i wish i did  more 'cause i like to cook at home but i just don't do it because i don't really feel like at the time and  it's you know it's new york you can get food anywhere  and also  [noise] a lot of the time you know now i  i eat out more but  when um  when i was working at restaurants  you have shifted meal  so it's like  you go into work and they feed you so  learn how to cook that much  and usually at the end of that that at the end of the day too there's food that you can <unk> so i don't really need to cook  oh i worked in the front of that  although there are definitely days uh dealing with certain customers that i  wish that i worked in the back of that and i actually there are a couple of days that i asked to trade with runners who wanted to do more waiting  because i was just like the cat with the customers right now  so if you wanna do this i'll be happy to uh take all the food at the table  and uh they were fortunately happily comply months of the time  still  [noise] i was able to identify although one of them which i'd never seen before um which i can only assume came from their bars because you know they've got like i'd always cracks me up i go into their birth  and uh they've got like this huge rack of uh  of all these cooking implements most of which i recognize but then there's always like some random thing that i'm like you know what you really don't need to sell and implement for thirty five dollars just for like take the stand off of an apple like you know whatever i mean is that kind of there was  of the emblem and she had i recognized you know all but this one that was it was uh  if like this egg shape thing that you rub your hands on to get the smell out apparently for um uh onions i think and garlic which i'd never seen before 
10 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  yeah no so uh  oh sorry  yeah but the thing is we mostly i mean we pretty um you know  uh-huh  unfortunately i mean i would like to get around the city more 'cause i love to travel and i it's weird because i actually know  i ended up knowing the cities that like  when we travel  like i'm going to brazil and the fall and i'm sure i'm going to end up knowing rio  they janeiro better than i know new york which is stupid but it usually ends up the way it is for me and also my sister who  [noise] you know she went on this whole world trip and i went and joined or  for a month we went to nepal together and like i got to know katmandu really well  but um  because usually when i'm in new york i'm working all the time  so i get up  you know i go to work and  maybe i'll get  a bite to eat somewhere close to where i work but then i go home or if not that that i'm going up to my dad's studio to paint  and um  you know i don't know i just i  it sucks you know it's like a <unk> you know how many new yorkers have never been to the empire state building or never gone to the statue of liberty that would be  i'm one of those new yorkers unfortunately  yeah  well i <unk> [noise]  i don't know i think it's because  i do travel a lot  like  even  even coming into a completely foreign city like katmandu  which was a trip and a half you know it's like going into the twilight zone  i don't know you don't feel like  i don't feel lost it's kind of like  you have the guidebook you've got your map and  you just  like i may meander  and sort of  you know end up some place  and uh  no exactly where i am but i guess i don't feel lost i just feel like i'm discovering something  neil  i don't know i mean last for me it's sort of a very specific like oh no i'm lost i don't know how to get back to where i am kind of thing  which is a feeling that i don't  i don't think i've ever really had it's always like oh wow this is a new place and this is how i came and saw go  back this way to get home  kind of deal  uh  sure it's possible the whole point of this whole thing is for me to bullshit you right  but um  oh i don't know why there would be incentive to get beyond  the section of the interview  sorry  oh wow  i don't know  is there in san diego incentive to get beyond this interview i don't know [noise]  i can't tell you that  i'm not supposed to tell you that i could be telling the truth  and i could've b. y.  i mean it could be it can be it could be either  i can't tell you them lying and telling the truth or not  so sorry and uh 
11 T/E:CIVICS  yeah  they do  i you know i mean  i don't think that they think of me if somebody who's rapidly interested  but <unk> you know we talk about it's certainly a lot  yeah and i was out with friends last night i would say the politics especially lately  and this is not true year ago or two years ago but certainly in the last year politics probably comes up  at least once a day when talking to co workers or friends  okay [laughter]
