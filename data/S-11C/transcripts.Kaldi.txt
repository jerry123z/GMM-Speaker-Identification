0 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  mhm mhm  did okay um  i  and  i think pretty coordinated at times  and  i did fine i think  i've received excellent  um  some very weak this morning and it's just  kind of  played games and i was younger and  oh he's very active so to things like that  um because i flipped well last night slept almost twelve hours  um generally  mhm  no [laughter]  somehow  it's morning was different yeah  [noise] um  i don't know  no but i just kind of followed  put the way it was looking in  somehow it worked out i think i just got lucky on that one actually  i do um lacrosse basketball and soccer played sports here for a little while actually  i do when i have time  so like  mhm  hello  mhm  mhm  i think people think that i follow directions while but sometimes i've had trouble with them like second grade i can remember having issues like reading directions and falling them and  um it takes me a while too  actually understand them but today i did well which was surprising for me but  i think people  would assume that i do 
1 T/E:MUSICAL  [noise] i did okay  i don't know i feel like it did okay and all these big scored me whatever i got  good but um  i'm not musical and  news alerts and  was not  yeah  talented with  singing but  mhm  um  and i just  mhm  okay  [noise] um  i  took a course in middle school  and also played  in the band in middle school  um but for maybe two years total so  for that  mhm  um  they enjoy listening to music and they enjoy music but nobody's really musical  i like stuff  on the radio rock and wrap r. and b. um don't really appreciate  instrumental or that type of stuff very much because i didn't  play instruments that much so i don't  appreciate it i guess  the truth so  mhm  [noise] um  yeah  mhm  at church last weekend  mhm  mhm  mhm  harder okay  mhm  so the survivor 
2 LD/HE:SURVIVAL  mhm  [noise]  really bad [laughter] actually um  i don't  really have any training and survival a first date so i  had no idea [laughter]  [noise] never  um family was never into it we are very much more the hotel and sharing typing and like so we didn't  really enjoy going out into the wilderness and roughing it so i have no idea what was going on  mhm  nope  i don't ski i don't  really enjoy swimming so  just don't really know and i guess they don't have a common sense to figure out the right answer  i had training like in middle school for babysitting clubs they had to come in and learn like  basic c._p._r. and first date stuff but they didn't asking those questions so  i just kind of had to guess and hope that i was right [laughter]  hello  mhm  never know i  i've always kind of  remained out of the wilderness and always have people around to help me if i had problems  mhm  no i mean not more than like a mandate or anything like that  oh we somebody else who's been around like to do with like my mom or a friend or something i've never  [noise] i've never really been in a situation with me and another person like walking through the woods and the snake comes up you know it's like i  things like that and never has just been me and somebody else i had to tend to so  i mean i really  i've never had a situation where i had to  i think i might be i guess and  get something right  mhm  mhm  i mean i think that i would  do the best that i couldn't the situation but  i mean  i don't know if i would  act appropriately and if i would  do the right i mean there there are certain first date i think in survival things that aren't necessarily intuitive and  i would do my best i don't  i would do something it's not like i would freeze but um  i don't know  what i would think is the correct thing so 
3 T/H:FOODWINE  mhm  mhm  i  okay i mean i  understood the basics of  like what glasses birth for what types of wine i couldn't actually say like  this is for this type of red wine i knew that's champagne that's read one that way when i didn't really know  the others so  did i did okay  oh sorry  okay um i guess fair  [noise]  i love food and i like to eat it and um  i just think i'd go out to dinner or a lot and  sort of listen when my mom talked me and tells me  you know what things i use for what and but  i mean i did well in some parts and not well and the others but i do have an interest in  that's it  um i  try to i don't really have  i have an interest in it  you don't have the time to do it sometimes  so  um  off and on maybe like twice a week i'll cook  cooking isn't  making some huge meal it's like maybe i'll put chicken on the grill or on the  actual pan or something and i will grill and like dorm  tiffany  [noise] i don't like the taste of wine but  lots of people that i go out to dinner with  or no like line so  hi  sort of have an understanding of it and i used a waitress so  i had no why a little bit but i don't like it myself  [noise] i work in an italian restaurant um where they had lots of wine and  italian dishes and whatever so  mhm  mhm  i wouldn't know  didn't taste it but people seem to like them or low lots of people drink red with i'm italian so  serving literate  [noise] yeah i think it would be cool to know a lot more about it um  like to take like maybe a wine  tasting class just to get to know because they feel like  or cultured if i knew that stuff but i don't know  mhm  no um we didn't really  eat much together at home  we went out a lot and had dinner watch together but  not really it with my parents now 
4 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY  [noise] i did pretty well i mean i i get around the city a lot um have a lot of friends that live around in downtown  um they've taken me a lot of places i've done a lot of exploring on my own so  actually did really well i was surprised i come from a very small town back in massachusetts and  really enjoyed the city  hello  [noise]  i got excellent which was um  pretty good i was impressed with myself that i have spent the last four years  getting snow city well so that's good  i'm a senior  yeah  [noise] i haven't actually um spent one in boston and then some at home and then in a smaller city near me so  kind of got used to the city thing and i think it made me appreciate new <unk> new york that much more like  just to get out and  no it and everything so  mhm  i kind of like doing it by myself more actually i mean  i like to but  then i kind of have to go and show them you know the statue of liberty neighboring state building everybody knows when that stuff is so it's kind of like if i had the chance i like to just take the subway as far as i can go and then like walk around and it's like oh there's that building and there's that and  so no i'd rather do it on my own actually  [noise]  um i think like a week ago right before easter break i went downtown 'cause monday's i have a lot of time for you that's why i'm here  um so i went down went to a couple of museums and just walked around  than a week before that went down to like alphabet city that was really fun in that area and stuff so  try to get around and more and more now that i have more free time as a senior and  in columbia college i can  kind of get out and spend a little more time so  i really haven't no i know manhattan really well so it was good that most of the places he asked me was  that manhattan borough but  i went to brooklyn maybe once  indian food i think  a friend of mine took me out there and then  it's always for food [laughter]  somewhere that i've gone otherwise but  i've only been probably to to the other boroughs the bronx in brooklyn  really love the village i don't know i think everybody kinda like that um everybody knows that so it's not that  special i guess but um i really enjoy it there's lots of  bars down there that  and i go to and  kind of mingle with n._y._u. crowd and whatever so good  i never get i have a really good sense of direction i always have a pocket map so i  don't think i've ever really  lost in salt lake oh my god so i mean i think if i went to the other boroughs and they were more  those are a little more difficult to get around and understand but  i've never been lost you always have a cell phone and i always have my <unk> i go rent that so 
5 LD/E:CIVICS  um  poor really badly um  <unk>  feel  comfortable with any of the questions  don't really understand  political science and  don't know much about it so i didn't really do very well so  never have and i really feel like i should so it was kind of embarrassing i guess i feel like i should have an interest and  no the presidents and know who  you know it was in my <unk> and  but people do and in the cabinet and i'm just completely  oblivious to it so  no i'm registered but i have yet to vote in any election so um  i wasn't home for two thousand i didn't get i didn't really know how to do the absentee ballot things so  i just really have not been very interested in kind of the only time i really pay attention to politics is  when like a friend in computer i mean in political science might  tell me something big is going on or somebody else listening to it i'll listen but  just not interested in i should be [laughter]  registered massachusetts  from my home town  mhm  um  not really more like the drama of politics but  not really what people are  like going for an lobbying for i don't really listen at all  i did but i don't remember that very well like i also took a class right  learned you know what the different cabinets were and like  branches of legislation and who does what and  don't remember anything i mean i can sort of  i sort of gas and a lot of the questions after like maybe watching c._n._n. or a._b._c. news and  hearing the names of people and especially with this new trial that's going on  but that nine eleven i i heard  a bunch of cabinet members for like  okay with those questions but  didn't get them all so i think that that's why i got the poor so  um it was a history honors history  yeah 'cause i think that the way it where i sold was more just  like writing papers and  having discussions i never really listen much to the lectures and  i mean i'm the type of student and i think my teacher understand that  i read things and i learn things and then i forget them two weeks later  so i can take the test and and do well on that but  as for remembering what she taught us  it's pretty bad i don't really remember some of the stuff  mhm  unfortunately  mhm  no nothing  i was forced to in my history class we had to actually go through and debate the constitution and pretend that we were like  delicate <unk> i guess  coming together to uh  to write it but that's the only time i've really cared about it and  as i told you don't really remember how much it which is not a good thing  [noise] i had to read parts of it  but not for the whole thing  mhm 
6 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  yeah  mhm  i mean i guess that  today especially  uh-huh  just  got a lot of rice last night and  just didn't have to process the directions that much it was just very basic and quick i guess when i think your actions i think  something that's very involved and  difficult and usually i have to think about them or read them over a couple of times um  this time i was just told and kind of went with it and  well i did it right so  i mean basic stuff like my uncle has a boat and a couple of times i had to like  not at our tie it to the to the doctor but  i mean it just  kind of follow the way that i mean i started at one end  oh they're not and i'd ninety seconds and it wasn't her to do  mm yeah surprisingly i know and i didn't even know the function and she told me after it used to like shorten the rope which was kinda cool  really  that's pretty cool yeah for me [laughter]  i had no idea that's incredible  wow  excellent  mhm  mhm  something went right today i guess i don't know 
7 LD/HE:SURVIVAL  i did poor  because i really have never  been out in the wilderness or  ever had any training except for that babysitting course but yeah  mhm  yeah  in <unk> massachusetts  that's me  [noise] it's very western mass  um like  near springfield i don't know if you've ever heard of that sneer since college actually the professor wouldn't either  mhm  i mean i've done outdoor activities but never to the point where it would just be too like i'm talking having two people out in the wilderness  i have to make a decision about first aid there's always been somebody else there that's better trained than i am  so i have no idea i've never had an interest or a need to know more so i just don't  never  uh-huh  my family we hated it i mean my parents had to go camping on their honeymoon 'cause they had so little money so  we never went because now that they had money they want to go and we'd rather hotel and go to you know amusement parks than go camping  one time with my boyfriend family and they all knew it i just kinda sat back and got to enjoy it so  hi  no idea  been camping once  camping  you i thought you meant generally i've been one  time camping  um but it's not something but going once  i don't need to know anything  i just kind of go [laughter] it's like a vacation 
8 LD/E:CIVICS  i did okay um  i  they've got it got poor i mean i didn't know i got like three of five on the answer is i think  i mean i like want to answer that one where we had to do like legislative or at the cabinet  um i didn't get them all right so i think that  kind of lowered my score but to me that was decent that i knew like factories state and two of them so that was it was okay  i know i should  i mean i plan to vote in this next election but i never had before
