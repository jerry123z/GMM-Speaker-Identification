0 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  mhm  yeah  interactive okay  well  excellent  yes  um just would you would you like me too like elaborate or this is you know just a like a one one were kind of answer  okay  hi fine just think that uh  you know i'm a drummer and that's helped me  developed coordination and such  so  certain tasks involving uh  you know making eight from such came easier  yeah  mhm  yeah  direction falling  huh  yeah  mhm  a better better than i thought it was uh  you know the instructions weren't too bad  i don't know given more complicated i don't know how i'd fair but this was not to challenge  yeah  you know you can uh  yeah in new york city you have to kind of how to get around a lot so  pick it up  um no i don't know how often that comes up within a context of a friendship  but i mean certainly ah  [noise]  certainly i don't think  yeah i think i'd be i think i'd be trusted  you know giving uh you know directions and such  uh when i'm with people i do kind of  you know like one more dominant one leading out you know a group of people somewhere  not timing it actually ah it has come up in the course of my <unk> my work sometimes  um i work i work for a concert venue and uh  last night i didn't have to tie a specialty not to reserve section of chairs so generally no i did kind of luck out in this case  yeah  i don't have a name for it unfortunately but uh  did  uh  not in a bow  i don't know it it did the job  mhm  uh-huh  i don't get the chance to off and um but  mhm  again if this was not the most challenging i don't <unk>  very suspicious of i think they are rigged but this uh  was a little bit different  yeah  do you uh soccer and track  um track coach might be a little more ah inclined to stand up for me uh  soccer coach  wasn't a huge fan of on a personal level so you might get a like a tainted response flexing 
1 T/E:MUSICAL  yeah  excellent  um you know i have had musical training you know i've played drums for many years  i also did uh some singing  huh  high school choir nothing too you know i'm not certainly not solace or anything but i can i can do pitch and stuff so not a problem  no  [noise]  no no it's not something i you know having a great passion for it so i really  um music is is important to me you know the big uh music collector and such but not  i don't think of myself as any ah any great talent i mean uh you know  this was this was just matching pitch this was this was not a problem i don't have i'm not going to pursue a career or anything  my music uh in terms of like you know majoring i do like music history i'm a big fan of that that's that's if anything what i'd like to pursue  ah nowadays i only really during research studies  that's about it  when's the last time i remember seeing uh  uh i i think i i did seeing uh  a party or at uh you know gathering of people wasn't really wasn't performance it was more to [noise] to prove a point i believe that's avid  uh then i'm not an awful thing er i was challenged  successful to a point you know again i'm not a star and just reasonably competent so  um uh my mum played piano  and uh i guess she kind of  she gave it up in her adult life and she she regrets that greatly so she did kind of put the burden on me and uh  uh my father absolutely non not  no i i can't think of anything that you've ever done musical  mhm  mhm 
2 LD/HE:SURVIVAL  so  uh well a lot of the scenarios felt very far fetched to me  um not a big fan of avalanches ah killer beef uh cornfields even the more uh harmless aspects of the scenario <unk> wasn't a big fan of you know the woods and such  no no i did go to a summer camp as a child but that was uh kinda like the outdoor the camping experience was very limited  it was more optional trips and i really never elected to do this to frequently  oh no  uh no no although i i work sometimes in a lot of parks in the city i wouldn't really call it well there's  um again most most of my friends uh  have not i've not really uh taken to the wilderness uh  uh maybe the ones who ah you know i know some people who live in like ah riverdale in the bronx  if it dies would you know what is it gets ah  you know i might get laugh that but i don't think they'd be too critical  first day training is uh  i mean i have i have a a general knowledge uh i'm a licensed fire guard  so i have i have very very limited um i uh i'm looking into taking first responder training um  but at this point my my knowledge is more you know theoretical much less practical  uh not not personally i uh i've been in a situation where i've had to call for help  uh-huh  mhm  a good number of times  but um  uh i've had i've had a radio of gone for help i never really had to do anything on my own but uh i wouldn't be i wouldn't be opposed to i think i could do that given the proper training  uh-huh  yeah  uh i i worked in a concert venue so  [noise] a lot situations arrive you can imagine  no  no  no not at all it's just like the most point blank  yeah  yeah  yes [laughter] 
3 T/H:FOODWINE  for  uh part of it is  um under age so the one now is  limited and also uh  everything it was a little high brow you know i did i uh i have to  you know if there had been something for uh  you know like a lobster i might have had a fighting chance  but that section did not go well it was very uh  very humbling  mhm  uh based on in general are based on like the test  in general um  you know i think i think it's better than  the score i got today which  god awful  but i mean i think  this was this was wine glasses and you know food utensils and if you act if you factor in food itself which was noticeably absent from the the question then i might have done better  uh you know i can't promise anything but i think i would have  let's say i i would have gone from like a one or two to possibly as high as a fix let's say  wouldn't get myself too much credit after that  and if i  yeah  mhm  mhm  this one they would probably be less forgiving  but uh you know survival  but uh  still understandable i mean some of those  excuse me  you know uh instruments were rather uh rare at least in my household  mhm  yeah  yeah  nope  [laughter]  um yeah but i would say so i just never really uh took a hand in preparing it and such  just my mom  yeah  um you know i've set the table but that ah that's a spoon knife in a fork and plates  so  did not have to uh  i can't even remember one of them now  for example  hum  yeah yeah i was i was kind of able to  like in a general sense identify some of the classes but when when it came down to specific names of wines i <unk> i bailed and that's that's where the points where  uh you know i i uh  i think i i got i got one of the <unk> the glasses i gotta i think the uh champagne  but you know that's the leaves me with poor so what kind of  uh  yeah  somewhat um not  you know we're not uh collectors we certainly don't like obsessed over you know i've you know you drink wine within the contact the family there but not you know we don't talk about the vintage  and uh what kind of glass to put it and we only have one kind of glass and it was uh that it's all purpose so 
4 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY  okay  this this was good this was excellent um yeah after two ah after two botch sections in a row it was starting to feel a little worthless so yeah  helped me come back a little  although you know i live in new york city i've lived here all my life so it's still considering you know the variety of subjects and the test  you know i guess if this is the one i walk away with it it's still a little pathetic but  mhm  um just you know in the course of your travel she  i you know ah do you know i've been to pretty much everything in the city at this point uh  huh  yeah i really can't say anything much other than that you know  just very practical knowledge whereas  wine you know like different classes i don't know i can't deal with it  um just you know exploring you areas walking around basically uh  yeah i mean i've never never gone through a <unk> you know in in new york city it's just uh  on the way to something you kind of pick up once three at a time i don't think you know didn't i wasn't born with it you know  mhm  um  yeah that's that's about it it's like  i think i taught myself the most just you know  huh  walking you know walking around you pick things up and uh  i live i live uptown but uh you know that obviously downtown it's been more chaotic uh  section of the city uh and you know i i i as i got like older i spent more time there so that and that was  i was mostly me so that um  yeah  so so i i taught myself just walking around down there  um i like the village lower east side those areas  uh subway subway you know i don't have a car so it's also very practical and uh they recently they raised the fare and caps so  um i i bet your taint a few friends uh let's see a friend of mine from california came last summer he stayed with me for two days  hum  yeah i i did come off you know very knowledgeable about the city  uh i think  yeah he was impressed  but um  you know i i don't have very many chances in general i guess  uh  give ah sometimes you know in the park a lot of tourists there central park they you know they come there  i do i uh i do give a lot of directions that specific places not too much in the city just in the park because there are a lot of tourist attractions you know like the uh the merry go round and things like that so  but  if i really city park knowledge  oh well that's that's pretty much up to them you know they uh uh you know gas comes first uh  mhm  but um  yeah  yeah and we'd go with that  yeah  well that's in new york city  um  i i don't think i've been law  a long long time i just  if you don't know where you're going you just basically keep walking till you hit something you know  that's the strategy and that's that ah it's becoming increasingly rare  i don't think there's ever a point where you're going to know every street in the city  oh you need to know is like  uh  you know uh a framework and you're fine i've really can't say i've been like last er yeah like gun panicky maybe when i was like twelve 
5 LD/E:CIVICS  yeah  um this was not so good this was this is again poor  uh  i would like to think you know i do better but  hum  [noise] well apparently i made some common mistake that's at least uh not remembering ah  other senator besides hilary clinton  i wasn't too but  um and also that  mhm  from out of the questions  uh i it's part of his age like  yeah it's kind of stupid mistake  ah screwing up the or the presidents  twenty years ago so  no  no  i don't even really get along with the politics like kids  yeah  very very good not just  um i i feel like they're they're all more  yeah hi this is kind of a new yorkers are generally generally aggressive people but i feel like they're also an aggressive bunch  and uh  you know they're they're more cut throat  that's what at least that's what they  no i haven't taken any courses but  uh-huh  that's what seems to be a case  too  one is uh international politics and what was american both introductory level courses i'm really not going to pursue it any further  uh there's some overlap in the ah psychology ah so awfully department  uh you know like but ah that might be interested in but we'll see about that  freshman  just finish freshman year  yeah  i came in ah basically ah we do a freshman level course where  they grew view with people ah  who they group you ah into dorms based on the freshman class you decide  and it was there it was like uh  no it was that kind of group of people  and uh that was my course and that was i was kind of encouraged to pursue that because i was  started grouped but um  um yeah i pretty much abandoned that track  oh they they would be surprised uh i did quite well  hum  i i think that with those were some of the easiest classes  uh you know it it's a it's a really big math and science school  and uh  you know  and basically are are weak point with english and history and that was kind of like you know uh that was the one chance you know i'm not the was not the brightest person in the school by any means and this was the playing field is much more level which is why i kinda uh remain interested  no i remained that that was why i kinda pursue interest in palestine  but um i i mean it turns out i'm not you know it's not my kind of thing it's just that within the context of the school  uh you know when you have kids doing uh you know perfect math course it's just it was a little less competitive so it was kind of drawn to it  um  mhm  hum  and i guess in a in a big fenced i'm not a big fan of like uh uh from uh invasions of privacy that have been going on in the news but uh  you know with the patriot act and such  i mean i'm not i'm not a really active or anything like that  huh  is that what you're looking for in terms of you know constitution or  okay  yeah so that's really all i can offer  hum  yeah i read ah i read ah new york magazine the new yorker  hum  huh  yeah i read the everything's on line so i'm not uh not committed subscriber anything besides those two magazines 'cause my parents get them  but um  yeah  that's about it  my least favorite politician  um i i'm not <unk> again i'm not a huge we uh political person but i am  i i'm not a big fan of the president right now  hum  not even for let's say issues just for uh uh some of his speeches i've kind of like fat through and watched  i just think like the the use of is language it's just so uh uh i i feel kind of offended too and i feel like uh  mhm  not even manipulated would be kind of giving him too much credit but i feel a [noise] i feel i feel like you've kind of degrading the english almost and some of the speeches  [noise] um  i i did uh i did the the mock trial program in ah junior year of high school  and uh that that was very encouraging it was sort of uh <unk> the new york state public school requirements you have to uh  it's american history that year so we kinda had to do it half and half and the it was a very rushed and <unk> class but um  that because we got to pretend to argue with each other it was it was very therapeutic at times so that that was kind of  yeah that that kind of brought about ah like ah interest because it was great class  this one there would be no mercy  mhm  um yeah i apparently there are a lot of forms to this to to the a lot of different questions different sects  i know ah i was <unk> so that means they're at least for a few uh given an alternate uh  number question i i could i could have gone either way just cutting all the way up to excellent but it didn't  uh-huh uh-huh  sure 
6 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  huh  why do i break character  nope  oh okay  uh well what uh what led you to believe that  uh i mean i i don't know i mean that was the first section we covered i'm walking in here uh i i don't know  ah i don't know how well you know you know uh like habits and such  but um  i don't know if you've been offered one example let's say  okay  that's probably the motivation for every <unk> well i mean i i read the waiver everyone who's not a student here  that's why they signed up so  huh  some  yeah i mean i i don't i think it would be very uh i don't think anyone could certainly deny the financial motivation  no no i yeah  profile is uh luckily i i'm pretty close 
7 T/E:MUSICAL  yeah  um  uh kind of i not so much it's not really something um it's something i did and uh it's not likely to be continued in in any fashion really so  i don't have any you know personal uh <unk> no you're doing your job that's fine 
8 LD/HE:SURVIVAL  yeah  okay well i i certainly uh uh thank you for thinking that i could you know survive but um  uh for unfortunately that's what i you know i don't take great join you know uh  uh sticking to the story about it  uh you know having  yeah i  mhm  i would have liked to uh you know for something better but i can't  okay  you skip the food and wine  oh oh okay my <unk> i can see  mhm  well first dating a uh a very urban contact let's say 
9 T/H:FOODWINE  um well i i feel i mean it's food and wine but there was no food involved  and uh it's a little cheap and the wine you know uh  i'm under age so  uh yeah i don't think it's unreasonable uh portland  huh  could you give that a <unk> a little more explanation  okay  i can't [noise] you know  i'm sorry i i i can't help you out with that one that's your choice  but i you know i gave you a  i answer your question <unk> uh as far as after that you know it's not much i can do  mhm 
10 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY  yeah  again  every  every answer here you know through our fault it's motivated by that and so i you know there's not  it's not much more i can tell you on that yeah that's  the nature study 
11 LD/E:CIVICS  yeah because that one was  that one came out of left field for me too i mean i don't i don't consider myself a poor  you know  uh port knowledge civics i would consider above average but uh  you know uh <unk> uh i work nights and this was distorted eleven thirty in the morning which is not ah early  huh  [laughter]  it's my characteristic of me but  and i'm not gonna try to say say it is but it's a <unk> tough  yeah  yeah
