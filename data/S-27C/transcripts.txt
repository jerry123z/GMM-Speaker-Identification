4 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY   okay./ this this was good./ this was excellent./ um, yeah./ after two, uh, after two botched sections in a row, it was -/ I was starting to feel a little worthless./ so./ you know./ this helped me come back a little./ although, you know, uh -/ I live in New York City./ I've lived here, you know, all my life./ so./<UNIN><~> still considering, you know, the variety of subjects on the test, you know, I guess if this is the one I walk away with it it's still a little pathetic./ but / <BR> um / just, you know, in the course of your travels you, uh, you know, uh, you, uh, you know, I been to pretty much everything in the city at this point./ uh / uh / yeah./ I really can't say anything much other than that, you know./ it's just -/ it's very practical knowledge./ whereas wine, you know, like different glasses./ I don't know./ I can't deal with that./ um / just, you know, exploring new areas, walking around./ basically, uh: / yeah, I mean, I've never never d- -/ I've never gone through a map or atlas, you know, in in New York City./ it's just, uh, uh, on the way to something, you kind of pick up one street at a time./ I don't think -/ you know, didn't -/ uh / I wasn't born with it./ you know./ that's, um, yeah./ that's that's about it./ that's all I got./ uh / I think I taught myself the most./ just, you know, uh / walking, you know, walking around, you pick things up./ and uh / you know, I live I live uptown./ but uh / you know that, obviously, downtown is the more chaotic, uh, section of the city./ uh / and, you know, I, <UNIN><~>/ as I got, like, older I spent more time there./ so that -/ and that was that was mostly me./ so that, um -/ yeah./ so, so I I taught myself, just walking around down there./ um / uh:<~> / like, the Village, lower east side, various./ uh, subway./ subway./ you know, I don't have a car./ so./ and it's also very impractical./ and uh / they recently -/ they raised the fare on cabs./ so./ um / I I've entertained a few friends./ uh / let's see./ a friend of mine from California came last summer./ he stayed with me for two days./ uh / yeah./ I I did come off, you know, very knowledgeable about the city./ uh, I think./ but, yeah./ he was impressed./ but um / you know, I I don't have very many chances in general, I guess./ uh / I give -/ uh / sometimes, you know, oh, in the park, uh, a lot of tourists are there./ Central Park -/ they, you know, they come there./ I do -/ I, uh, I do give a lot of directions about specific places./ not so much in the city./ just in the park because there are a lot of tourist attractions, you know, like the the;<~> merry go round and things like that./ so./ but / that's not really city./ that's Central Park knowledge./ uh / well, that's that's pretty much up to them./ you know, they're, uh -/ the, you know, guest comes first./ uh / <SN> but um / yeah./ yeah, I'm going to go with that./ that's all I got./ lost in New York City./ um / <BR> I I don't think I've been lost in a long, long time./ I just -/ i-<~> if you don't know where you're going you just basically keep walking till you hit something you know, that's the strategy./ and that's that, uh -/ it's becoming increasingly rare./ and I don't think there's ever a point where you're going to know every street in the city./ all you need to know is, like, uh, you know, uh, a framework, and you're fine./ I<~> I've -/ I really can't say I've been like lost or, you know, like, gotten panicky./ maybe when I was, like, twelve./
5 LD/E:CIVICS   yeah./ um / this was not so good./ this was this was again poor./ uh / I would like to think, you know, I'd do better./ but / um / <BR> <SN> well, apparently I made some common mistakes./ that's at least by, uh, not remembering, uh, the other senator besides Hillary Clinton./ that wasn't too good./ um / and also that the<~> uh / some of the other questions./ uh / I -/ it part of it is age./ like, you know, I<~> -/ it was kind of a stupid mistake, uh, screwing up the order of the Presidents./ but, you know, it was twenty years ago./ so./ no./ no./ I don't even really get along with the poli-sci kids./ they're very very obnoxious./ um / I<~> I feel like they're they're all more yeah, <UNIN>, this is kind of <UNIN>:<~> -/ New Yorkers are generally generally agressive people./ but <BR> I feel like they're also an agressive bunch./ and uh / you know./ they're they're more cut throat./ that's what, at least, that's what they -/ you know, I haven't taken many courses, but uh / that's what seems to be the case./ two./ one is, uh, international politics./ one was American./ both introductory level courses./ I'm really not gonna pursue it any further./ uh / there's some overlap in the, uh, psychology, uh, philosophy department, rather./ uh / <UNIN><~> you know, like, but uh -/ that I might be interested in./ but, you know, we'll see about that./ freshman./ just finished freshman year./ yeah./ I came in, <UNIN> -/ basically, uh, we do a freshman level course where they group you with people, uh, who -/ they group you, uh, into dorms based on the freshman class you you decide./ and it was very -/ it was like a -/ you know, it was that kind of group of people./ and uh<~> / that was my course./ that was -/ I was kind of encouraged to pursue that because I was -/ you're sort of grouped./ but um / I'm<~> -/ yeah./ I pretty much abandoned that track./ oh, they they would be surprised./ uh / I did quite well./ um / uh<~> / I I think that was -/ those were some of the easiest classes./ uh / you know./ it it's, uh, it's a really big math and science school./ and uh / you know./ <UNIN><~> and basically our our weak point was English and and history./ and that was kind of, like, you know -/ that was the one chance -/ you know, I'm not the -/ was not the brightest person in the school by any means./ and this was -/ the the playing field was much more level./ which is why I kind of, uh, remained interested./ no./ I remained -/ that that was why I kind of, uh<~>, pursued, an interest in poli-sci./ but um / uh / I mean, it turns out -/ I'm not, you know -/ it's not my kind of thing./ it's just that within the context of the school -/ uh / you know, when you have kids doing, uh, you know, perfect math scores, it's just, it was a little less competetive./ so I was kind of drawn to it./ um / <BR> uh / in, I guess, in a in a big sense I'm not a big fan of, like, uh, uh, some of the, you know, invasions of privacy that have been going on in the news./ but uh / you know, with the, like, Patriot Act and such./ but, I mean, I'm not, I'm not, uh<~>, really active, or, in anything like that./ I don't really, uh -/ is that what you're looking for in terms of, you know, Constitution?/ or -/ okay./ that's all -/ that's really all I can offer./ um / yeah./ I read, uh, I read, uh<~>, New York magazine./ the New Yorker./ um / uh / yeah, I I read I read things online./ so I'm not, uh, I'm not a committed subscriber to anything besides those two magazies -cause my parents get them./ but um / yeah./ uh / that's about it./ my

issues./ just for, uh, <BR> uh<~> some of the speeches I've kind of, like, sat through and watched./ I just think, like, the the use of his language -/ it's just so, uh, <UNIN><~> -/ I I feel condescended to and I feel like, uh, <SN> not even -/ manipulated would be kind of giving him too much credit./ but I feel, uh, <BR> I feel I feel like he's kind of degrading the <BR> English, almost, in some of the speeches./ <BR> um / I I did, uh, I did the the mock trial program <BR> in, uh, junior year of high school./ and uh / that that was very encouraging./ it was sort of, uh, the the New

/ the -/ that because we got to we got to argue with each other./ it was <BR> it was very theraputic at times./ so that that was kind of -/ yeah./ tha:<~> that kind of brought it out of, like, a
