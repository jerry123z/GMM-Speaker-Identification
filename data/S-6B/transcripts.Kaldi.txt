2 T/HE:SURVIVAL  mhm  um well you know i've been camping a few times that everybody's kind of be like oh you gotta know first date i worked at camp that sort of stuff so you know like the basics but  nothing like super outstanding  missouri i'm from  they're sophomores in high school  yeah you go out like it's generally uh educational camp but there are like two side trips during the camp that you go and it's like the not survival but it's just like team building and stuff where you're out and everybody has to work together and that sort of thing  oh yeah absolutely  [laughter] yeah i've set up many tens mostly in the dark for some reason a lot of weight to camp ground and things so  um  yeah try to uh make sure everyone that you're you're with is like out of the way when you're putting together the tent pools voids stabbing each other it's always very important  um  basically like know how to set it up in the light and then it's not so hard in the dark but car headlights they're useful that's another good too  um we didn't do it over camp last summer but i'd say two years ago when i went on a road trip with my best friend we were everywhere late  uh for a week in colorado  that was two years ago with my best friend  um no not really like survival skills were pretty safe the whole time and like national parks and stuff  yeah absolutely  mhm  mhm  i don't have any first day training  yeah  that sounds pretty <unk> 
3 T/E:FOODWINE  mhm  pretty good  uh i i took highschool home back i eat food i don't drink wine size little off there  but uh  yeah that was pretty common knowledge questions  mhm  excellent i would say  so you  no i don't drink so  no not really i'm not really wine pass or drink or of any sort [noise] so it doesn't really hold interest for me  excellent good somewhere in that range i said pretty good the first time and i think that was what it was  yeah everybody likes eating  yeah absolutely  [noise] i'm vegetarian so  all sorts of like stir fries and <unk> and vegetable <unk> thing  um not so much mostly my mom took care of all that we just hate it  yeah  absolutely  uh not too fine i have a college but it budget but ah yeah  pretty good food i don't want to eat at mcdonalds every day or anything like that yeah  decent meals  round the city  i'd say  uh once a week  uh mexico huh one incident couple of nights ago  that's good  i like macs a high there quite a bit  oh no 
4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  mhm  not very good at all  [laughter] i'm from missouri oh like a small kansas city's not small town but i am from outskirts of kansas city  i'm not accustomed to that [laughter] like knowing which street and which avenue everything's on i sort of go with the flow of people around  just a couple of years  mostly at columbia um  just one summer last summer  yeah  i was working all the time so i was mostly just in columbia area i've been um centered up here the whole time  um not too much just you know like every now and then go out with a group of people on the weekend or whatever to wherever [laughter] this is kind of what's happening is determined by them i just kinda go with what's going on  um i'm in the lower east side  ah  subway i mean like [noise] the the f. tree and i think is the one that goes there  actually i have a friend coming tomorrow i'm pretty excited but er  when i was here during the summer a couple of people came by but they sort of determine their own trips you know it's like we want to go to the mat and so i would like look up and see what the <unk> and we would go there but  i haven't really been like in charge of tour groups or anything  um well she is probably gonna want to go to museums and things will probably go out to eat so  probably will  go to whatever museum she wants which we can look up pretty easily and maybe just down to the village for dinner  sorry [laughter]  yeah absolutely tons of the time  uh i always get mixed up down like around penn station i don't know i get turned around and the buildings are tall i sounds mid west and um but  usually i'm pretty good with like cardinal directions in general but in new york i have a lot of trouble like when i get out of the subway remembering which way it which and so i always get messed up down around there  i went to brooklyn once uh just like bedford uh  that's about it  um i don't i don't know what trained as subway but i'm not sure which one it is  [laughter] i would say i had a good sense of carnal directions but not a good sense of direction in new york  [noise] so  i guess 
5 LU/H:CIVICS  mhm  pretty good  um  i  i pay a lot of attention to politics so it was excellent i guess  uh  i wouldn't say i've always been interested in it but since i came to college i live with a group of very politically active people and just like i'd say in the past two years i've become really interested in like i watch the news and try and follow what's going on and all that sort of stuff  um new york politics i pay less attention too but i'm on a lot of like action alert lifts and stuff like that so like if there's some sketchy bill going through congress and i don't want it to pass the night send letters cause i'm registered to vote in new york so i send letters to my representatives here  mhm  yeah pay attention to it i mean it's important if i'm sending them letters that i know their names  i did indeed  [laughter] it's been sort of a disaster i've been registered for a couple of years all the time that i've lived here  but uh  it's gotten mixed up like they lose my address all the time it's really frustrating so they're always getting <unk> david ballots for me which is annoying i'm always calling people but i have been registered ever since i came here because i wanted to vote as soon as i got it so it's important to me to vote  learner  mhm  <unk> eighty seven or something like that  yeah i voted in local elections one of my friends was actually like uh  prominent ah city councilman and so it was always like important in high school not in high school like we couldn't vote but it was just like you know one of the things that we were paying attention to because he was involved in politics and so when i was old enough to vote at the end of high school yeah i've heard of that  [laughter] i wasn't so good at in high school but our civics most of the consisted of uh memorizing the presidents and when they were president and i i wasn't too into the members nation process  yeah i think it would be  uh i'm interested in that it you know defined what rights we have as americans and it's sort of an integral part of life in america but i'm i'm not like a constitutional scholar by any regard  i mean it's yeah  i  looked at the constitution i know about the constitution  yeah  high school  yeah i think so we had to memorize preamble and then we had to read all the amendments and all that good stuff i guess that's the bill of rights but uh  i i'm pretty sure we went over the whole constitution  okay  yeah  mhm
