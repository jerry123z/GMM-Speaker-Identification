2 LU/HE:SURVIVAL  mhm  [noise] i <unk> really well excellent i was really surprised  um because you know i grew up in a suburban i never really thought that i had these skills but um i guess i really kind of picked him up <unk> new hampshire and i spend a lot of time outside and um you know i've got camping a lot and so i just i i didn't realize that it's kind of pick them up along the way sort of thing  so i was very happy about that  um not so much but you know i was in the girl scouts and i was younger and um they really every year they they <unk> they tell you them over and over so i mean i've never really been attacked by mount lennon or anything like that but i you know  heard about stories people that have and what they did to get out and that sort of thing  first they chaining um well i went through trained to be a lifeguard one summer and so you know one part of that a few c._p._r. and all that regular first date  um that you learn  um i could you know i help them out and i know right away to call the paramedics that i feel like depending upon the severity i wouldn't know you know enough to  [noise] make sure that it was you know minimize wherever the damage was before the paramedics out there  [noise] camping um this past summer actually um i was visiting a friend of mine as well and we went camping  in the mountains there  that was really fun  [noise] um well not really actually because we were staying at a campground we had tense um there are no medical emergencies we brought plenty of food and so actually the <unk>  easy going camping trip actually 
3 T/E:FOODWINE  mhm yeah  um i did good on this  uh-huh  oh sure actually my mother um you know the silverware she used to um they had a motel her family growing up and so she always tells me when we're setting the people for <unk> family holidays you know it's just a salad i haven't this is this i just kind of pick up things about that um also my parents like to drink a lot of wine or where ever had a dinner they always you know are getting wine and so i know which um  which ah glasses which i'm just kind of i don't know picked it up by being around them  uh yeah i do like wind but i'm not a wind kind of store i don't ask for the  eighty two more low or whatever like drink  um i unfortunately don't do much cooking um kind of like macaroni and cheese with my specialty  but um i definitely knew a lot of the cooking utensils i think from just  helping my mother and high school or being with friends that like to cook a lot so  well it depends on what i'm in the mood for but generally i just you know kind of stay around someplace mourning type  um  i like mexican food a lot so maybe i'll go to you know the heights or mexican food restaurant  um i mean i feel like as all get older i'll start  mhm  kind of deciding which ones um i like more than other ones and right now i kinda just order whatever the other people and when they're drinking and so yeah i think i'll pursue that more 
4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  mhm  unfortunately i did kind of poor um [laughter] um  yeah i'm a little bit of embarrassment it actually  [laughter]  um i feel if because one of my closest friends here um actually a lot of my close friends here new yorker so whenever i go anywhere i just kinda hop on the subway with them and they pick me where i'm going and i've never really  worried about where i'm going before and figuring out by myself  um well it depends you know if i'm going to go  shopping or something i'll probably just cut down to thirty fourth street and go to macy's um which is pretty easy to get too i know it's right off the one nine so i don't have to worry about anything  um but  you know at night i really  honestly one of my friends will say hey i'm going through this bar and i'll just happen to cap it don't make oh and half the time i'm not even sure you know  exactly in the city we have  um no i've never spent a summer in new york actually both can hope to boston  um actually not a lot of my friends that are from you know the south are from california always need friends coming to visit and all my friends are from boston my home town friends and  they've never come down to visit me  and when my parents do they only come down for a night and we kinda go to a broadway show and i go out to dinner and that's all and so i've never really done the whole  tour guide for a dating all around new york city  [noise]  no [laughter]  not at all i went to brooklyn for the first time oh a few weeks ago and i've never been to queens  the bronx unless you count the bronx zoo and i've never been to staten island  automatic lost in new york  no i never really think of myself as being law school i always like it just hit like habit i can get <unk> wherever i need to go  but last time i really didn't know  oh my friend and i had gone down  to the village and we'd watch all the way to the river and then we were walking up  and it was totally deserted we have no idea where we were i don't  i don't know maybe with it  meat packing district teeth out but i didn't know where that was what was going on  [laughter] 
5 LU/H:CIVICS  mhm  um i did um  good on it  um i don't know kind of being at columbia uh there's always  articles about politicians in the newspapers people always talking about politics you kind of  you can't really avoid hearing all about it basically  um i do find it interesting even though i'm not sending political science i'm i'm very interested in  kind of our country interact with the rest of the world and that just goes right down to you know who's in power who's in the senate who's in the house what laws are going through what's happening um  so i do find it very interesting  yeah i always felt  nope i bought a mess [laughter]  um i actually do um my mother always simply absentee ballots and i make sure i vote for the town um <unk> what is it town  yeah town committee or whatever and the borders elect men and all those other representative  um i saw them a little bit um  since i'm not from new york state i'm not as  oh in touch with the actual politics senators and stuff from here i kind of sick more you know national politics i find that more interesting  mhm  yeah i mean you've got like i said you can't just pick it up you read the newspapers is always being said  you hear about you know  hillary clinton buying a house in new york and she'd be centre i mean just you just kind of hear about that stuff happening  i'm in new york times on line i also read c._n._n. um b._b._c. on line  no actually growing up um i mean kind of living in a suburb but i don't really care about it at all but once you're in new york and you're at a school at columbia you really people to start talking about it and you get thrown into these debates and so i mean  i think everyone here kind of gets interested in it  [noise] oh i didn't really have a high school civic teacher actually um we just had history classes more we didn't really ever have current events but i mean i doubt that they think i did  well and we never really discuss politics of any stores any of my classes so  i'm a senior  right  right exactly  mhm  [noise] um  i mean  yes i am but i'm not entirely i've never really read through the constitution has a whole i don't really  no when people you know make 'em references to different articles in or what not i'm not sure exactly what they're talking about  [noise] okay  sure 
6 LU/HE:SURVIVAL  right  um well  okay  i guess well i mean  how many people have actually been an avalanche but they still know how to get out of the avalanche you know i kinda you don't have to necessarily live through it to know how to  you know survive it um  i mean i think just growing up outside and going outside a lot kinda helped i mean doing things outside hiking and camping and things like that you get told  hum  you know when i was in the girl scouts growing up we go camping a lot and they tell you all the survival skills newer ranger contact you and  my mother bought me um  um  worst case survival <unk> from her book store and so i definitely know that one winter break just reading  through all of that it just kind of remember it a lot of stuff so 
7 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  yeah unfortunately i think the places she picked i just wasn't  exactly sure where they were often times i just take cabs places and you just say the name of an area you know and they know how to get you there  you don't have to know treat addresses so  well i didn't know where the meatpacking district [laughter] <unk> that's where we thought we were  um well i picked up all the names of the boroughs  i mean you hear people saying them but i you know for a while i didn't even really understand  where the <unk> in a relationship <unk>  that's it like you know where everything was um  i think also the the location she might have just asked i just  like i said i know we're macy's is you know i don't know exactly where bloomingdales us though that sort of thing where she asked me so i think just  some of the one she picked out i just wasn't  totally sure about i mean also besides ask any questions about the lower half of the island  i've no idea where anything is down there and all the street  numbers stopping there's just roads going this way and wall street is somewhere i don't know  so i mean i'm really bad with that but 
8 LU/H:CIVICS  an excellent portland  [laughter]  well like i said i don't really follow new york  politics all that often all i really get is what i read it  and new york times but i often don't even really read the local section i'm more interested in international  um things that are happening in that's why i've kinda learned more but just the national  politics [noise]  things that are happening with the president of the cabinet and  and all that sort of stuff that's why i've kind of picked up that  more so than the actual new york  governor mayor cut her all that stuff i don't really pay attention to that as much i do my home town  oh it's because my mother asked me to always end up down because of my town one person's count really does count you one person's vote just 'cause there's so few of us but um i mean i don't vote for the mayor or the governor or anything of new york so i don't really follow that much  yeah i mean i was lately surprised about that but i mean i think once again the question she asked i just happen to know those you know  maine and things like  to be president and one of the qualifications i just happened to live  you know some of them i just knew you know thirty five an older and all that sort of stuff i just yeah  okay
