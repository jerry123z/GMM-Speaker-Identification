2 LU/HE:SURVIVAL   mhm./ I actually did f- really well./ excellent./ I was really surprised./ um / because, you know, I grew up in a suburb, and I never really thought that I had these skills, but, <BR> um, I guess I realized I kind of picked them up./ I have a ski house in New Hampshire, and I spend a lot of time outside and, um, <BR> you know, I've gone camping a lot./ and so I just -/ I<~> I didn't realize I just kind of picked them up along the way, sort of thing./ so I was very happy about that./ um / not so much./ but, you know, I was in the Girl Scouts when I was younger./ and um / they really -/ every year they they pound- -/ like, they tell you them over and over./ so I mean, I've never really been in -/ been attacked by a mountain lion or anything like that, but I've, you know, heard about stories, people that have, and what they did to get out, and that sort of thing./ first aid training./ um / well I went through training to be a lifeguard one summer, and so, you know, one part of that is doing C.P.R. and all that regular first aid, um, that you would learn./ um / I could f-, you know, help them out, and I'd know right away to call the paramedics./ but I feel like depending upon the severity I would know, <BR> you know, enough to m-<~> make sure that th- -/ it was, you know, minimized, whatever the damage was, before the paramedics got there./ camping, um, this past summer, actually./ um<~> / I was visiting a friend in Venezuela, and we went camping in the mountains there./ so that was really fun./ <SN> um / well, not really, actually, because we were staying at a campground./ we had tents./ um / there were no medical emergenicies./ we'd brought plenty of food./ and so, actually, it was a v- pretty easygoing camping trip, actually<LG>./
3 T/E:FOODWINE   mm, yes./ um / I did good on this./ um / I'm not really sure, actually./ my mother, um, you know, with the silverware she used to, um -/ they had a motel, her family growing up, and so she always tells me when we're setting the table for fl- family holidays, you know, this is the salad knife, and this is this./ so I just kind of picked up things about that./ um / also, my parents like to drink a lot of wine, and whenever we're out at dinner they always, you know, are getting wine, and so I'd know which, um, which, uh<~>, glass is which./ and I've just kind of, I don't know, picked it up by being around them./ um / yeah, I do like wine, but I'm not a wine connoisseur./ I don't ask for the eighty two merlot or whatever<LG> when<LG> I<LG> go<LG> out<LG> to<LG> drink./ um / I unfortunately don't do much cooking./ um / kind of like macaroni and cheese is my specialty./ but, um , I definitely knew a lot of the cooking utensils, I think, from just, you know, helping my mother in high school or being with friends that like to cook a lot./ so / well, it depends upon what I'm in the mood for, but generally I just, you know, kind of stay around someplace in Morningside Heights./ um / I like Mexican food a lot, so maybe i'll go to, you know, the Heights or a Mexican food restaurant./ <LG> um<LG> / I mean, I feel like as I'll get older I'll start, <UNIN><~> kind of, deciding which wines, um<~>, I like more than other wines and s- -/ right now I kind of just order whatever the other people I'm with are drinking, and so, yeah, I think I'll pursue that more./
4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY   mhm./ unfortunately I did kind of poor<LG> on<LG> that<LG>./ um<LG> / yeah, I'm a little bit embarrassed<LG> about it, actually<LG>./ <LG> um / I've realized because one of my closest friends here, um -/ actually, a lot of my close friends here are New Yorkers, so whenever I go anywhere I just kind of hop on the subway with them, and they take me s- where I'm going, and I've never really worried about where I'm going before and figuring<LG> it<LG> out<LG> by<LG> myself<LG>./ um / well, it depends, you know, if I'm gonna go shopping or something I'll probably just head down to thirty fourth street and go to Macy's, um, which is pretty easy to get to./ I know it's right off the one nine so I don't have to worry about anything./ um / but, you know, at night I really -/ honestly, one of my friends will say hey I'm going to this bar, and I'll just hop in a cab with them and go, and half the time I'm not even sure, you know, where exactly in the city we<LG> are<LG>./ um / no./ I've never spent a summer in New York, actually./ I've always gone home to Boston./ um / s- -/ actually, not a lot of my friends that are from, you know, the south or from California always have friends coming to visit./ and all of my friends are from Boston./ my hometown friends./ and they've never come down to visit me./ and when my parents do they only come down for a night, and we kind of go to a Broadway show and then go out to dinner, and that's all, and so I've never really done the whole tour guide for a day thing all around New York City./ <BR> no./ not at all./ I went to Brooklyn for the first time, um, l- -/ a few weeks ago, and I've never been to Queens, the Bronx, unless you count the Bronx Zoo, and I've never been to Staten Island./ <BR> last time I was lost in New York./ well, I don't -/ I never really think of myself as being lost -cause I always know I can just hail a cab, and I can get to wherever I need to go./ but last time I really didn't know -/ oh, my friend and I had gone down to the Village, and we'd walked all the way to the river./ and then we were walking up, and it was totally deserted, and we had no<LG> idea where we were<LG>./ I don't I don't know./ maybe it was the m- Meat Packing District he thought, but I didn't know where<LG> that<LG> was<LG> or<LG> what<LG> was<LG> going<LG> on<LG>./ <LG>
5 LU/H:CIVICS   mhm./ um / I did, um, good on it./ um / I don't know./ kind of being at Columbia there's always articles about politicians in the newspapers./ people are always talking about politics./ you kind of -/ you can't really avoid hearing all about it, basically./ um / I do find it interesting even though I'm not studying political science./ I'm very interested in, you know, kind of how our country interacts with the rest of the world, and that just goes right down to who's in power, who's in the senate, who's in the house, what laws are going through, what's happening./ um / so I do find it very interesting./ yeah, I always vote./ nope, I vote in Massachusetts./ um / I actually do./ um / my mother always sends me absentee ballots, and I make sure I vote for the town, um<~>, comm- -/ what is it?/ town -/ yeah, town committee or whatever and the board of selectment and all those other representatives./ um / I follow them a little bit./ I'm <UNIN><~> -/ since I'm not from New York State I'm not as<~>, you know, in touch with the actual politics, senators, and stuff from here./ I kind of stick to more, you know, national politics./ I find that more interesting./ <SN> <SN> yeah, y- -/ I mean you kind of, like I said, you kind of just, like, pick it up./ you read the newspapers./ it's always being said./ you hear about, you know, Hillary Clinton: buying a house in New York so she can be senator./ I mean, just, you just kind of hear about that stuff happening./ um / I read New York Times online./ I also read C.N.N., um, and B.B.C. online./ no./ actually, growing up, um, I mean, kind of living in a suburb I didn't really care about it at all./ but once you're in New York and you're at a school like Columbia, you really -/ people just start talking about it, and you get thrown into these debates./ and, so, I mean, I think everyone here kind of gets interested in it./ <BR> well, I didn't really have a high school civics teacher, actually./ um / we just had history classes more./ we didn't really ever have current events./ but, I mean, I doubt that they'd think I did well./ and, uh, we never really discussed politics of any sort in my classes./ so / I'm a senior./ right./ right/. exactly./ <SN> um / I mean, yes, I am./ but I'm -/ not entirely -/ I've never really read through the Constitution<MP> as a whole./ I don't really know when people, you know, make, um, references to different articles <UNIN> whatnot./ I'm not always sure exactly what they're talking about./  okay./ sure./
6 LU/HE:SURVIVAL  right./ um / well: / okay./ I guess n- -/ well, I mean, how many people have actually been in an avalanche?/ but they still know how to get out of an avalanche, you know./ I kind of -/ you don't have to necessarily live through it to know how to, you know, survive it./ um / I mean, I think just growing up outside and going outside a lot kind of helped./ I mean, doing things outside, hiking and camping and things like that, you get told, um, you know -/ when I was in the Girl Scouts growing up we'd go camping a lot, and they'd tell you all the survival skills, and you would have a ranger come talk to you./ and, you know, my mother bought me, um,  a worst case survival handbook once from her bookstore./ and so I definitely, you know, spent one winter break just reading through all of that and just kind of remembered a lot of the stuff./ so /
7 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY   yeah./ unfortunately, I think the places she's picked I just wasn't exactly sure: where they were./ often times I just take cabs places, and you just say the name of an area, you know, and they know how to get you there./ you don't have to know the street addresses./ so / well, I didn't know where the Meat Packing<LG> District<LG> was<LG>./ my friend just said that's where we thought we were./ um / well, I picked up all the names of the boroughs, just -cause, I mean, you hear people saying them./ but I, <LG> you know, for a while I didn't even really understand where the Bronx<LG> was<LG> in<LG> relationship<LG> to<LG> Queens<LG>./ and that th- -/ like, you know, where everything was./ um / I think also the the locations she might have just asked I just didn't, you know -/ like I said, I know where Macy's is, you know./ I don't know exactly where Bloomingdale's is, though./ that sort of thing where she asked me./ so, I think, just some of the ones she picked out I just wasn't totally sure about./ I mean, also, if you start to ask me questions about the lower half of the island, I have no<LG> idea<LG> where<LG> anything<LG> is<LG> down<LG> there when all the streets numbers stop, and there's just roads going this way and Wall Street is somewhere./ I don't know./ so<LG>, I<LG> mean<LG>, I'm<LG> really<LG> bad<LG> with<LG> that<LG> part<LG>./
8 LU/H:CIVICS  I got an excellent score on that./ yeah./ well, like I said, I don't really follow New York politics all that often./ all I really get is what I read in New York Times, but I often don't even really read the local sections./ I'm more interested in international, um, things that are happening, and that's why I've kind of learned more about just the national politics./ things that are happening with the President and the cabinet and and all that sort of stuff./ so that's why I've kind of picked up that more so than the actual New York Governor:, Mayor, et cetera./ all that stuff./ I don't really pay attention to that as much I do at my home town./ also because my mother asks me to always send out the absentee ballots./ -cause in my town one person's count really does count./ I mean one person's vote does./ -cause there's so few of us./ but, um, I mean, I don't, you know, vote for the Mayor or the Governor or anything of New York, so I don't really follow that all too much./ yeah./ I mean, I was slightly surprised about that./ but, I mean, I think once again the questions she asked I just happened to know those, you know./ random things like to be a President, one of the qualifications I just happened to have, you know -/ some of them I just knew, you know, thirty five and older, and all that sort of stuff I just -/ yeah./ okay./
