1 LD/E:MUSICAL  not so well  um  well  hi <unk>  no um some of the  i guess they were a nursery rhymes or whatever  and um  also  i guess my  performance of the ones that i did know wasn't all that great  [laughter]  not at all  i mean i played the recorder and like fifth grade and that was  that makes sense of my musical ability  other than listening to um  uh music in the car and stuff  no nothing  [laughter]  i enjoy listening to music but i wouldn't say that  um  it's you know and uh not really necessary part of my life  oh see that's the kind of thing i mean i'm kind of non discriminating and i don't really look for any type of music  i just kind of throw on you know  whatever radio station  kind of just habit in there for the background  [laughter]  [laughter]  uh let's see  i don't know i can't remember the last time i did but  mhm  not really  i mean other than you know going to church and stuff but  you know  me and my brothers we didn't really  have music lessons or anything  um  same kind of thing we were just listen to music when rent a car or you know it's  there were people over maybe we'd  they're on  you know the radio or the tape or a c._d. or whatever  but nothing kind of nothing that we really thought out  ah my mother used to play the piano when she was little but um  she doesn't anymore we don't have a piano home so  um [noise]  mhm  i mean  yeah no one really does anything anymore  mhm 
2 T/HE:SURVIVAL  mhm  i did  um fairly decently  um  i think those questions were  pretty much  general you know kind of  uh-huh  living life questions but you know you tend to pick up  um if you go um  [noise] um  no  nah  not directly  but um  i was uh  boy scout  uh and a cub scouts so i kind of picked up some stuff there  mhm  no  none  but i do do a lot of  you know a lot of the questions involved kind of outdoor activity um  and i tend to  do a lot of those things skiing swimming  um so  and i've done um you know since i was little so  you know growing up in your swimming you kind of learn how to deal with  yeah  ah survival questions with water when you've ski you learn how to deal with you know things like that um so  no  mhm  no 
3 LU/H:FOODWINE  very well  mhm  excellent  yeah [laughter]  well [noise]  [noise] um  i like to eat out a lot and  kind of i like that  whole lifestyle so  that was just  kind of something that  uh-huh  again that's kind of information that you pick up along the way  i do enjoy whine a lot  um  yeah i feel like i know  uh-huh  you know a moderate amounts for especially for someone my age  um  [noise] i like  uh i'm actually very seasonal  um [noise] in the  summer  i tend to drink uh santa margarita peanut ratio um all the time  then in the winter i drink for those  usually  when it's cold outside  um  wall street journal food in mine  uh restaurants from some of the earth  uh-huh  talking to people  um  that kinda thing  yeah definitely definitely oh if the holidays we'd have  we buy <unk> you know cases  and then  er actually  at the beginning of every season we buy you know a couple of cases keep it in the wind feller uh the wind refrigerator sorry  and then um  yeah  and every holiday with meals um you know when the family was together we would always serve wine and it's like that  [noise] um  see with a two thousand <unk>  i do  um again it's seasonal in the winter it tends to be um kind of  provincial food so like french provincial or italian provincial very hearty  uh kind of food like that  uh-huh  and in the summer  more  grilling  kind of lighter meats  um so like fish chicken pork whereas in the winter it would be more like a [noise] be for something like that  uh food network [laughter]  um  i wouldn't  uh-huh  it was uh  [laughter]  i mean there was no pressure to  cook really it was kind of more  um you know  mhm  maybe  um  like my mother always called  and then  you know if you if any one show didn't interest they could kind of help her out or whatever  but then recently i started taking over holidays like i did thanksgiving  um by myself kind of coordinating the menu and you know  cooking the food just because  [noise] uh  i want it to kind of step it up  mhm  mhm  mhm  they weren't really well for the  second thanksgiving i've done  uh it was  um  mhm  would call it  um <unk> and um  uh  oh what do you call it  uh-huh  well i can't even remember the name of it but i bought pounds of <unk>  <unk> nothing 
4 T/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  oh excellent  um  uh-huh  i don't know being born and raised in new york  i just feel like  so that's  kind of stuff those are questions um landmarks that you tend to know where they are really  yeah  mhm  i do live on campus  [noise] um  union square  lately and um  i guess kind of  across the twenties so from union square to meat packing  there's a lot of you know good restaurants and bars and whatnot  so that that tends to be where i am  um  yes  i mean  not  a considerable amount but you know i've been there enough  uh-huh  [laughter]  not really  um  i mean i don't like bringing them too  and the traditional way of showing them you know this is the empire state building this is you know rockefeller center that's the central park but  [laughter]  if i have  so anything tourists do you don't really like to do but um  yes  it's just you know bringing someone out to dinner or you know bringing them out to a bar or something like that you know i really don't mind  [laughter]  [laughter]  i think new york is more of a  experienced in seeing any one thing so um  i would tell them to probably  [laughter]  eat at a [noise] as many good restaurants as possible and um  walk around and get a feel for the city so walk around fifth avenue walk round so walk round trade back uh um  and kind of  just get a feel for the different neighborhoods and so they can find out which one  you know the <unk> the best so when they come back they can just keep on you know going to the same neighborhood  mhm  [noise] i get lost a lot when i go  <unk>  um  <unk> where the numbers run out  actually i get lost in the  west village a lot  we're all the streets kind of um  uh-huh  start  going into dead ends or  [noise] snake and then  pick up somewhere else and  oh excuse me  [noise] [noise]  [laughter] 
5 T/E:CIVICS  excellent  mhm  um  a combination of things i think  a lot of it [noise]  it's  hum  material covered in any high school history class  um  and then just  hello  that's  all kinds of compounded by reading  you know newspapers and  paying attention in class now these are kind of topics but [noise]  uh-huh  you know you should  uh-huh  one would think that you know uh columbia student would know the answers to  um  yeah  i would say so  uh-huh  i don't because  um  new york's not a swing state  so i tend not to  um  yeah i vote when there's um  uh may oral race  but  uh-huh  i don't usually vote  i haven't been voting for it  get stricter assemblymen compliment because  i don't really have a neighborhood yet so  my knee to vote if not really  uh-huh i don't feel so compelled  just now  mhm  yeah i think so  i mean um  it's pretty interesting  uh-huh  i guess it's kind of the foundation of  [noise] the country so  um  i guess that's where that interest comes from  yeah definitely  um  and it's actually kind of i've  <unk> started to revisit it  um it started  you know  just watching west wing marathons on bravo so  um that's kind of  something that's gotten me  you know back into  the whole political arena  um  right  in its entirety i think so yeah at some point 
6 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  yes  mhm  i think so yeah i mean um  for example  let's see  uh-huh  yeah  i mean  mhm  when you train your body too  um  when you're trained for a sport for example like i played  uh-huh  tennis competitive  competitively all through high school um  and when you change when you train  um  that much and you work  that much on um kind of  uh-huh  following  in in terms of um  listening to what a coach has to say about your technique for example you know  um [noise]  oh my serve or whatever  um  being able to kind of those er  skills that you learn how to  i guess they're like hand eye coordination  not <unk> but like  you're  wait  <unk> whatever it is like you hear the direction in you can kind of translate that into movement  so i think yeah that definitely has kind of a bearing on  um what  on my performance there  no i think not tiring actually [noise] i was able to do um through um what do you call it boy scouts  yeah  i think so because uh let's see  did one exercise though it's kind of carnival in style so  um  mhm  i guess that  uh-huh  again it goes back to just  being pretty good  athletically i wouldn't 'cause you don't go in practice for a carnival game right  just kind of  good <unk> good at it or you're not so i mean  i guess the those two questions kind of time together 
7 LD/E:MUSICAL  [noise] sure  that's correct  uh-huh  [noise] um  i think  [laughter] when  people thai food winding music together  um  mm they typically  include you know it seems like  they include like the classical music or opera and whatnot  [noise] um  and that's just not really something that kind of  interest me  um  again it's like  i  consider music more of a background thing and not something that i seek out  um  actively  um  it's just  something that may enhance the mood  um for example  when i'm in a restaurant [noise]  i think that the whole experiences and joy <unk>  um you know because they've  but the whole thing together  um  but  i can never recreate that in my home because you know i wouldn't know what music uh kind of  get or purchase  rarely very rarely because there's um  <unk> there's not that much music that um  i kind of want to  here  or that i feel compelled to pay  yeah  x. amount of dollars for  uh-huh  to pay for a ticket 
8 LU/H:FOODWINE  mhm  i wouldn't be surprised actually  i think so because um  mhm  [noise] when you're at a restaurant and you order wind you kind of  you know which um  which classes they go in um and then having  having an interest in food and kind of  cooking actually that surprises me a lot that they didn't know you know  what kind of  um  mhm  what kind of what  it's very a few <unk> cooking utensils were being used for 
9 T/E:CIVICS  mhm  [noise]  mhm  yeah that's correct  right  um  well  [noise]  i think er  uh-huh  the questions that were uh  weren't really  uh-huh  they were more national in school then they were  stayed in school  so um  i would say that  yeah  those are the questions they covered by  um  history classes and  um  you know the front page of  times and  the first section of the times more than  local politics and whatnot  okay
