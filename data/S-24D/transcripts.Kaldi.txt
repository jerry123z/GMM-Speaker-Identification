4 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY  how'd you doing  good good um excellent  what do you think he's into the  uh well i was  uh i was born in new york  [noise] um  new york city proper up on long island and  to get a lot of exposure to the city growing up  and my answer all the questions right about  the landmarks around the city  um  and i live in the city for eight years but i've lived in like so many parts of the city so i've seen a lot so and when you're unemployed i was unemployed for a year um you get a lot of time to explore that [laughter]  um  well i used to live by the cloisters  and i love the question was ah i think it's really beautiful um i also love central park i've always been a member of central park  um  [noise]  i like my neighbor now which is hell's kitchen  um  because of the food there you know 'cause i can always get could take out  um  where else do i like  south street seaport  like that a lot  'cause i work down there  um [noise]  and the traditional tourists do things i'm really not a fan of like cetera liberty empire state building  you know dread going that want to have  people come to visit  from other places  yeah  um i have a lot of friends from california who went to school with  um  and  uh you know just relatives that come visit and stuff like that  so there i have a lot of relatives from long island that  don't really get much <unk> much exposure to the city so they wanna do some of the things  you know like that so  mhm  [noise] [noise]  mhm  mhm  mhm  [noise] um  well if they want the traditional experience right the empire state building um statue of liberty battery park city  um central park certainly  south street seaport  um  if they want a non traditional experience um  i would  probably take 'em to the cloisters  i probably would  probably take them to  um  some of the smaller parts from the city  madison square park  um <unk> square park where that's like a pretty um rich history  hum  there's some great museums that are kind of off the beaten track  um you know so not that guggenheim transfer thoroughly but  museum of sex to new york city if i knew when people can talk about pets um  and um  take 'em for ice cream  you know take 'em to the west village  it's like  um  maybe queens 'cause my sister lives in astoria  um  and  brooklyn i don't really know new jersey that well  um  staten island it's like a mystery to me so  so i'd say brooklyn queens  probably a little more  uh not the bronx either i'm not really familiar with the bronx  um myself  'cause i had to do it i mean when i first moved to the city i was living in with them  i was taking cabs down to midtown which got to be really expensive so i kind of had to  take the subway and explore on my own and get lost and  so and then i was unemployed for a while so um and then i was cleaning houses for a while  that kind of  all across the city and um so having that time really helped  lost in the city  oh i can't really say i was lost but coming here i mean trying to navigate through columbus campus isn't so you know easy  oh um  but i i can't remember us out of their moms per se  yeah  [noise]  mm this is inside  <unk> as a reminder  i've been doing it all around okay [laughter]  kidding  mhm  mhm [laughter]  mhm  mhm 
5 T/E:CIVICS  yeah actually i thought i would have done  i thought it would have done better than than i did i thought i was actually answering some of the questions right but  she was telling me all them so  poor  um i did um finance and <unk> like  mhm  because it just doesn't interest me  okay  you know she asked me the three  you know arms of the government  and um  like what what  some of the cabinet members were on it really doesn't i mean i vote but  like it doesn't really  hate to say but i say who cares you know  i'm not civic minded  and uh  mm mm  that's in now and we weren't really talked about current events at all  um  oh really yeah  that's right  i don't think surprise  um  well maybe <unk> maybe that would be surprised because i tend to collect little fact towards i tend to have a really good memory  um so  <unk> maybe the fact that i pick up some of that stuff just from  you know being around but  i don't think it's probably some  mhm  [laughter]  mhm  yeah  yes  than i am and i've been registered since i was eighteen  'cause i was actually a very excited to  to vote for clinton  uh-huh  and the election  so which reminds me i got to do that card  mhm  mhm  no i rode her in ninety two  um  i think that was left yeah i'm pretty sure this last time i thought it  huh  [noise] um i read am deli that  three page drag that you know you <unk>  um  and sometimes the daily news  if i find a free copy lying around  um we we had to take like  government one on one or whatever that was like introduction to government but  yeah it wasn't my major it wasn't interesting to me  and um i was turned two major set and have a lot of time for  you know things like that plus like basket weaving and whatnot so  well that i think they you know i did well in my government course i remember that i got like a <unk> but  um  but if i wasn't like civic minded  i think they wouldn't be surprised  um  i mean i know it said to my rights  to find my rights but  um  doesn't really affect me unless something's being taken away [laughter]  uh no  <unk> i mean i i don't know if anyone who's ever really read the <unk> i think it's pretty long  that and the declaration of independence i'm not so sure about like what the  differences  i couldn't tell you probably but i know that they're both  important documents  one being poor [laughter]  two or three  mhm  that'd be the section 
6 LD/E:INTERACTIVE  yeah  that is the truth  mhm  'cause i  some things i got some things  i didn't get like the  the ring toss thing  i don't think to myself this very athletic so i missed that like six or seven times  um  you know  so the walking with my hands clothes  and with my eyes closed  um i was like a foot off  um but then other things like you know it was okay and  mhm 
7 LU/H:MUSICAL  that's the truth  okay  that i scored excellent  okay  um no but i that's correct put on it  yeah  no there's no  yep  mhm  exactly  understand what someone might  sure  um  i mean i was i was told to fit but actually that do really well in that section  maybe not the other ones but that one i did  sort of survivor  mhm 
8 T/HE:SURVIVAL  that is the truth  no i mean i don't want to either [laughter]  mhm  well there's a whole you know macho element yes  you know wanting to be braver than you are  and um  wanting to be in control  certain  bad situation  reporting that you've had more training you actually have had  mhm  [noise] 
9 LD/E:FOODWINE  mhm  mhm  mhm  your responses clearly in the case  well actually i  i didn't [laughter]  and you know  mhm  sure  mhm  mhm  [laughter]  it's been since essential  yeah i mean i um i mean i'd like to say that  you know  yeah  no that food that i really don't  i don't know any of the tools or that  glasses or anything like that  seems like  mhm  really  mhm  mhm  well i didn't ask for it but  uh-huh  actually it it kind of fit to me because i have like a huge amount of credit card debt  instead of my mother's trying to get me to  you know make  cheap dishes  she found this mission to get me to pay them a credit card debt as opposed to like  get takeout so  in that sense of makes sense and  it also makes sense because  yeah  it can turn it on  but for ten hours and i have to worry about  starting it or anything like that 
10 LU/H:NYCGEOGRAPHY  for  oh i'm sorry that was excellent  i couldn't i looked at it  huh  um  one of the other ones  so so  eight  correct  um  mhm  i don't know  i don't know  mhm  well i mean if the task is  you know if you're told that you're  supposed to last part of the experiment  um  you know and uh  get one over on u. penn you might try to do that  uh not in this case 
11 T/E:CIVICS  and uh again  mhm  okay  mhm  i don't think my responses  i i wouldn't make  pick the gas at mars sponsors mean  that i did well in that section  yeah  i couldn't answer  probably many questions about it so  i would think  do poorly  mhm  so [noise]  mhm  um not completely random head i mean i do know certain things you know pick up i know that hillary clinton's our senator  but i couldn't tell you the other one was  mhm  so uh  which i made myself here two or three  oh for  that is the truth
