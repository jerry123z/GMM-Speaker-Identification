1 LD/E:MUSICAL   <BR> okay, the -/ well, I th- I think I was alright, except -/ I don't know./ I forgot part of the National Anthem, which was -/ uh / <UNIN> uh / <UNIN> I don't know./ I<~> -/ the parts about the <BR> the bombs bursting in air./ I could remember that, but that was about all./ <BR> uh / I -/ my score was overall pretty poor./ <BR> <BR> I m- -/ I listen to the -/ I listen to my, you know, M.P. threes and stuff, but that's about all./ <BR> I used to play th- drums in, like, middle school band and high school band./ but / um / <BR> in college I just haven't really done much <BR> ./ I had a little p- -/ I had a few, some piano lessons, when I was a kid./ not really./ like, my my dad is, uh -/ I think he did kind of the same thing that I did./ he used to play with, you know -/ in his high school./ but my mom is -/ just never really got into it, and, so it's not one of those musical families where the parents are always -/ you know, were conservatory students or were just kind of exposing me to stuff all the time./ but I would say it's definitely not true./ <BR> I mean, I would listen to the oldies in the car with my dad, that's about it./ <BR> uh / I grew up in Illinois./ anyone, uh, besides my parents?/ no./ uh / important to me, not, like, <BR> oh, you know, this is my passion./ <UNIN> it's important<MP> to me in that it's n- -/ I need it to just, kind of, relax, but that's about it./ <BR> <BR> I'd say I'd say p- -/ you know./ I'd say I think they'd be, uh -/ they'd understand./ you know, like, I I listen to some of the same music they do./ but when they when it comes to, like, do I know something about Mozart?/ do I know something about -/ <BR> m- uh<~> these famous people?/ if it's not something about -/ that I've had in music home, they're not going to be surprised about it./ <BR> <BR>
2 LU/HE:SURVIVAL   survival./ okay./ <BR> I did very well on the survival section./ <BR> <BR> I think part of it was due to having some experience in Boy Scouts and also just having been camping and just been to some, like, outdoors types of places, um, <BR> with with friends and on my own./ uh / well, I was up to Star, so that's -/ I think it was through third or f- -/ I mean, I was t- technically in the organization till I was eighteen./ but, you know, r- I'd stopped kind of getting into it in high school and kind of let it slide./ so./ I don't know./ three, four years./ not anymore, but in wis- -/ um / <BR> back<LG> in<LG> illinois<LG> I used to I used to go camping./ <BR> um / <BR> no, I went camping in Illinois./ I took <UNIN> C.P.R. at the Red Cross once./ uh / yeah, I did./ <BR> uh / that was two or three years ago./ not sure./ yeah, though I c- I could even use more training./ I mean, I was at, um, <BR> I was at church last week and somebody fainted./ and everyone just sort of standing around looking like startled<MP> deer./ so, you know, there you expect that there's gonna be a doctor or somebody, but pretty much you really need to be prepared./ um / for example, there was somebody who, um, flopped over in the sandwich line in Winter Hall, and nobody was really acting, so I went over and, like, treated for shock./ um / had somebody call CAVA./ that's the campus E.M.T. people./ and, you know, it's just kind of -/ there's a level of preparation that I've got, but I could see how you need need to really be up on this stuff./ <BR> <BR> uh / not particularly, no./ uh, I mean the point is half of that is just avoidance, so, like, using your map, staying together, following the trail, that kind of thing./ <BR> <BR>
3 T/E:FOODWINE  <LG> um / I I did I did alright./ <BR> <BR> um / I<~> -/ technically it's called good./ <BR> uh / I trace it back to, uh, middle school home economics./ <LG> <BR> uh / no, actually, I don't t- -/ I don't cook too much./ but that's not what we learned in home ec, you know./ it was how -/ it was etiquette and that kind of thing./ that seemed to be the m- -/ the focus of this section./ <BR> uh / <BR> no: <BR> more or less than the next guy./ no, a- -/ that was the most difficult part./ uh / Italian, I guess, is my favorite./ <BR> I'd say I had some every day./ <BR> <BR> um / <BR> I I guess not./ it's not like we came from, uh -/ you kn- -/ like, my dad is an Italian who is -/ would always making the family recipe./ <BR>
4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY   okay./ uh / I I didn't do too well./ I <UNIN> -/ <BR> um / poor./ <BR> <UNIN> <LG> um / <BR> I<~> I'd say just mostly from being a student here./ I mean, it's not like I really go around town a lot./ I'm pretty much on campus doing my work./ um / so / my -/ the parts of the city that I know about are pretty limited./ no./ I I usually go back home./ yeah./ yeah./ um / if I go out on the weekends?/ uh / well, I usually I usually go jog./ so./ I go to Central Park./ so./ I knew that question<LG>./ <BR> uh / actually, no./ I've I've set foot in Brooklyn one day./ that's all./ <BR> yeah, I had a couple friends who are also in college./ <BR> so./ <BR> yeah, like, we went to a couple shows./ we -/ you know, I took them over to to, um, Riverside Park, and we walked around./ oh, I I guess I usually take the subway./ usually the the one nine./ the East V- -/ um, not really./ I mean, I think it takes a long time to get there./ so / uh / it's<LG> it's, you know, Morningside Heights <LG> ninety percent of the time<LG>./ um / <BR> I guess lost, uh: -/ I don't know./ I don't know if I've really been lost./ I mean, you have to leave to be lost<LG>./ and you have to not have a map./ and they always -/ there's always somebody you can ask./ like, I was one time looking for this record store, <BR> and couldn't find it./ but I just asked some guy walking a dog who a- appeared to be a local./ so./ he didn't know where it was either./ <LG> <BR> uh / w- -/ I thi- -/ it was, like, midtown, like, twenty sixth street./ midtown, I think./ <BR> uh / probably probably Battery Park./ I went down there to check it out, and you could see the Statue./ <BR> <BR> <BR>
5 LU/H:CIVICS  uh / I did just fine, yeah./ <BR> excellent./ <BR> um / I think it was because in high school we had to take this, uh, contemporary civilization course that was, like, about modern issues in America, uh, twice./ and that was just purely luck of the draw, and my class being the one that got screwed when they changed the curriculum./ so / I had two semesters of civics instead of one./ <BR> no, actually, I vote back home./ <BR> <BR> um / as<MP> much as I can./ I mean, I read the Political Review when it comes to me in <UNIN> Hall./ and my my best friend's on the board, so I just go talk to him about it sometimes./ um / I guess I just keep the Times, and I check out the Wall Street Journal a little bit./ um / <BR> and, you know, I'm not -/ I'd say that's about the limit of my reading, you know, in respect to -/ <BR> yeah./ <BR> although <BR> it tends to be the kind of, you know, philosophical, international politics sort of discussions that you get with college students./ <BR> oh, I think it tends to -/ I've become more aware of it, at least, in the New York State respect./ with with the reporting that happens in the Political Review and the Spec, I think, um / as far as domestic politics at a national scale, there's nothing more politically involved here than at home./ and you can get the Times there, too./ <BR> <BR> uh / that's a good question./ uh / I don't know./ I<~>, uh<~>, depends where I go to grad school./ yeah./ I mean, I think that makes the most s- sense if I'm going to be there for a long time./ you know, if I stay here I'll register to vote here, but for now I'm just studying here./ I'm only here, like, two thirds of the year./ so / I think until I have -/ I'm here long enough to build up a real familiarity with it, and, you know, more so than that, like, you know, the name,s you know, all this stuff, have an actual interest in it, then I'll, you know, change my registration./ yeah./ you get an absentee ballot./ um / I'm not disinterested./ I mean, it's important to know<LG> about, I guess./ <LG> <BR> <BR> yeah./ <BR> <LG> um / the most interesting part of the constitution./ uh / I think it's <BR> -/ I'd probably say to see a few of the changes that have occurred and to -/ if you get an edition where they've got the original stuff that is, um, before amendments have passed, before -/ uh, and then you can kind of compare the few changes in the -/ significant changes that have gone through, like <UNIN> compromise, or something./ that's interesting./ <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR> okay./ okay./ <BR>
6 LD/E:MUSICAL   no./ I mean, my dad's a former musician, like, <UNIN> -/ no, I mean it's just, like, something I I do to, you know, distract myself from homework./ <LG> <BR> <BR> <BR> I mean, I I sort of play the drums./ I like to bang on them if I get the chance, but -/ you know it'd be cool to be in a band or something./ uh / I did poorly./
7 LU/HE:SURVIVAL   <BR> yeah./ <BR> um / <BR> I camped first of all with the Boy Scouts./ and then I just kept doing it even though I wasn't, uh, active in scouting./ it's in Illinois./ <OTE> no./ <BR> um / <BR> I had to lie about my birthday, uh, birth information, unfortunately./ <BR> so that's where the confusion is./ <LG> <LG> um<LG> / you you may think whatever you like./ I think, uh -/ if you would like to cast the entire interview into doubt, that would be, uh, the way to go./ <LG> </OTE> <LG> <LG> <BR>
8 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  <BR> <BR> well, I didn't get there but I w- I was supposed to./ that was where it was supposed to be./ no, I never found it./ uh / nothing in particular./
