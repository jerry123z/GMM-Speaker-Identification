5 T/E:CIVICS  yeah  right what  excellent  uh a surprise actually 'cause of the questions [laughter] pretty easy  hum  but uh but i also follow politics  uh yeah a couple of newspapers every day and watch the news and uh i don't know i'm interested so  and i wasn't surprised that i did while i was surprised how he's at the questions were  uh uh level of interests like eight or nine  that's how 'bout that same to them about it enough  um in new york times in the washington post every day i sometimes read the l._a. times  um i read the new york radio books like every two weeks i guess um  try to read hard person the new yorker but i get sick of them sometimes um  uh and other than that like uh  nothing else regularly but i'll pick up the atlanta kinda nation ordinary public um  i used to work for the new criteria and uh so i look at it sometimes to  uh get an idea what the other side's doing [laughter]  yeah  um i well this'll be my first  actually you know i bought it in the primaries but um  uh i don't think i'll be here i think i'm uh i'm going to be funny in oregon  yeah  ah [laughter] finish uh in two weeks  if i actually do the work [laughter]  yeah i mean uh probably couldn't raise side it for you but you know i think it's important  uh i didn't have a high school civics course  uh-huh  see  i took uh uh political science class and uh at community college i went to during high school  but that guy <unk>  i'm probably though any high school teacher would be surprised when i was interested in anything  that shit believe in uh  she's one of my primary targets that thing about this [laughter]  excellent  mhm  uh yeah i'm telling the truth so [laughter] i don't know  it's funny if you think i'm lying but i don't think you do  yeah

7 LU/H:MUSICAL  mhm  okay  uh-huh  uh-huh  uh-huh  i mean i really do have a pretty wide knowledge of music  hum  i think probably the reason you don't believe me is that um is that i i don't have any actual talent for producing music which is entirely true  um but i have a huge appetite for it i listen to all kinds of things 
8 T/HE:SURVIVAL  oh poor  [laughter] <unk> me i'm a little upset about it  hum  i mean i'd be happy if i was a little little safer about being outside [laughter] 
9 LU/E:FOODWINE  that's excellent  uh i think it's because i took a lot and i try to eat out um i just try to learn  uh-huh  you know we talked about wine and stuff um  but uh  and that's something i could just like an area that i that i try to order things  yeah
