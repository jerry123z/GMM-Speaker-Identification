2 T/HE:SURVIVAL  oh poor  we could even say very poor but i guess that wasn't one of the choices  huh  mhm  i'm not an <unk> type person i mean i've never really gone in for the the hiking camping type thing so it's just never been my thing to learn any of that stuff i guess  uh west islip new york  um it's my yard mostly um we had uh wasn't really even close to any parks and stuff um so i really didn't do any of that type of thing and it was a typical suburban areas i mean it was all you know housing tracts and everything  no actually it doesn't interest me at least  i mean i do want to survive but [laughter]  uh well yeah i mean here in the city i'm outside but i don't know that i would call that wilderness  no i've um i've never had any kind of training and i've never really had any occasion to use anything like that  of course i've seen the er the posters that they have in uh uh in the restaurants to do in case of joking but uh i really don't know if i would actually do that or not i'm sure i would kill the guy  [noise] um no actually didn't do that one  um yeah not time  yeah not too bad  ah probably panic to some extent not really knowing what to do  ah typical  um here in manhattan  uh i've lived in the same place place on that now um almost thirteen years  uh thirteen years

4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  uh it did not do as well as i expected to especially i live here [laughter]  mhm  [noise] i sort of know things but i don't know where they are um not a very exact person when it comes to that  absolutely and and that i mean i i can follow very things very precisely and everything but uh [noise] put me in a car or directions or something like that and it's uh and it's not precise it sort of like landmark type thing so you know make a left with the empire state building or something like that when you get there  [noise] uh i live uh by the strand sexually on twelfth street  twelve years  [noise] ah before here i was living in the store you  [noise] um  [noise] yeah i mostly i go out to um to a friend's places um go out to the movies  um  night clubs and things like that  oh i can't say that i do [laughter]  oh wait i'll take that back i mean i i do enjoy go visiting um the uh the botanic gardens  out in brooklyn it's about the only time i ever get out to uh to brooklyn  um no not really [noise]  [noise] um no not really  i did i lived in the story but it's not a particular place that i hang out or anything and even when i lived in a story i guess i would more or less come into to manhattan  doesn't everybody [laughter]  um most of the time i will walk if it's within a reasonable distance and um other times i will take the subway  occasionally taking the bus  [laughter] a lot of hit or miss actually [laughter]  uh i remember uh one of the one of the first times that i took the subway and um  uh i i stayed at a friend's house actually in uh in queens and um i had to have some sort of meeting here in manhattan and i got on v. h. rain and no concept of uptown downtown or anything else and found myself way up there  [noise] and um it was just wondering where i am i wonder if when i'm going to get back to where i need to go and stuff like that it's actually pretty funny  um well i don't really get lost i mean i'll get out like um i'll get out of the subway or something and i won't know which way to go  and it's sort of have to like look around and see what's around me what's familiar  and um try to hidden in a particular direction i mean it's it makes it a lot easier that the the streets are basically numbered and stuff so you only have to walk a block to know if you're going the right way or not  what do i think um  i don't i'm not sure [laughter] 
5 T/E:CIVICS  um probably pay attention to ah to the news a little bit uh watch some news i read some news um i try to stay up on current events some of the friends that i uh that i hang out with um also enjoy these topics so we we talk about things and politics and stuff like that  yes  everyone  um to some extent i i'm probably fit the profile of a lot of people who pays more attention to the bigger stuff than to the local stuff  uh about the the civics section  um well it is but i mean the specifics can be on a local level or on a national level too  i guess it depends on what's questions are that are asked  uh yeah more so now this year than ever before [noise]  i guess a little bit of the politics is going to come through with me now right [laughter]  um certainly for a fact i've read pieces of it i can't say that i've actually just sat down and said i'm going to just read the whole constitution now  um it wasn't specific i mean social studies we certainly have uh you know civics and everything in there  but uh nothing specific that just sit and you know it was a civic last  oh they wouldn't be surprised  ah well every time magazine all the time and um  i get uh a lot of news off the internet um uh largely from c._n._n. dot com  okay 
6 LU/H:INTERACTIVE  um i can't say for sure  um yeah mhm  no  yeah  i mean you do have to allow for the case that uh it is actually true  i suppose they would 
7 LD/E:MUSICAL  i really did quite poor thing only musical section  that's the truth  with ten being the worst  [laughter] i love it [laughter]  um i probably the last time was just a like a birthday party or something singing happy birthday  um i don't actually play any instruments my brother plays the drums  yeah  yes  uh that's a little pushy [laughter]  i think you're going to decide that i told the truth  certainly not on this and that's the truth 
8 T/HE:SURVIVAL  [noise] ah what my outdoors is basically uh when when it was a kid and uh i think i said uh i stayed you know i was out in my yard and played out in the yard for a little bit but uh  that was pretty much um where i did my outside stuff and now i'm just in the city i mean i'm just definitely not a [noise] a wilderness type of person
