3 T/E:FOODWINE   okay./ I did, like, um, <LG> good<LG>./ just in the middle./ yeah./ it was good./ um / I think because I -/ it's not -/ it's, uh, not just automatic skills that you that you pick up./ you have to learn these things./ and I I paid attention um / I made myself learn a few dining skills./ <LN> no./ not that often./ um / I would say -/ I would say yes./ yeah./ um / not really um / the kind of food that I, um, I'm exposed to now./ I would say we definitely ate different things and prepared them differently./ and um / yeah./ did things a lot differently when I was growing up./ but um / it was still pretty important./ um / well / <BR> um / I guess um / it's very hard to say./ um / mostly things that are made, well, I mean, you know I could say -/ mostly things that are made with, uh, really fresh vegetables. um / probably from my hm / from um / this is a very difficult question./ um / probably from my, uh, sisters./ because I think we learned a lot of the same things at the same time./ and / yeah./ and we were able to experiment with things./ two./ uh / no.

4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY   um / let's see./ oh./ um / I didn't do very well./ um <LG> / poorly./ um / eight years./ that was in, uh, nineteen ninety six./ um / well, I guess you you go places./ but you don't really -/ I mean, you can walk there, you can -/ you can tell somebody how to get there but you don't really remember what street they're on./ and / in particular, I was asked questions where between what and what streets, so you know generally how to get there./ you know, it's sort of mid-town./ but you don't remember the actual streets./ and / I can remember things -/ I can remember a lot of times what letter things start with, but I can't remember, like, the name of -/ a whole f- whole name of certain landmarks./ so I'm like, it starts with an H, but -/ you know./ yeah./ like, the names for tunnels./ you know./ I live in Brooklyn./ um: / two years./ in Manhattan./ um / let's see./ um / I think I know Manhattan best./ um / probably my my neighborhood./ small neighborhood./ in Brooklyn./ um, Fort Greene./ um / I like to stay in Brooklyn./ like, the neighborhoods, like, around, um, like, um / Carol Gardens, Park Slope, Fort Greene, whatever./ you know./ closer to the um / closer to home./ um / yeah./ every once in a while./ um / oh./ um / well I like to take people to museums./ and / um / on the Staten Island Ferry./ and I like to take them to um / um <LG> -/ I like to take them up where they have a nice view./ if it's a nice day./ and / like the -bser- observation tower in the Empire State Building./ and / um / I like to take them to Coney Island./ and Central Park./ mostly, you know, large landmarks, rather than, um, rather than other things./ um / well./ for people who -/ to come there um / it's very important./ because those are the things that they know about already./ so you have to do those./ and then you can go from there./ if there's time./ <OTQ> okay./ <LN> <LN> mhm./ yeah./ </OTQ.>
5 LU/H:CIVICS   very well./ excellent./ well, um / like, I'm a history major./ and / you just have to know what's going on right now./ so I read the newspaper regularly./ and um / I took a couple classes in political science./ so./ um / like, you just have to keep, um -/ be aware of what these, uh, governmental positions are./ things like that./ um, what school?/ um / Hunter./ um: / yes./ um / <UNIN> but I:, um, but I don't think I want to, um, go into that, um./ like as, you know, any further, like./ like, as, as far as, um, in school./ yes./ so./ um / I think that that, um, that she wouldn't be surprised at all./ that she would expect that./ um / probably not as well as I did./ because it seems like I'm always asking questions of people./ and / if I'm asking some questions then probably I don't know the answer./ but I think because we're talking about these things a lot of the time, you know, it's in I guess these these this information is, like, there./ um / I read the, um, New York Times./ and the New York Review of Books./ and the um / New York Observer./ um / yes, I think so./ I mean, not not um / well, yes./ they are./ <LG> okay./ yes./ um / the last being, like, a very -/ like a pr-, um -/ small election?/ or um / well, I could say the last election that took place I voted here./ last November, was it?/ but I think there was an election since then./ that was just um, like, city or something./ and that I didn't vote at./ I think./ <SN> <LG> uh, yes./ I do./ um / yes. they do./ um / I guess, um, -cause I'll start conversations about um / different um / different things that are current./ you know?/ things that are before the, um, Supreme Court./ or / that, um, are -/ representatives are considering./ before they go into law, or before they make decisions./ so I like to keep aware of that./ um / yes./ <LG> naturally<LG>./ um / um ? what can I say?/ <LG> should I elaborate?/ uh / in<LG> the<LG> Constitution<LG>./ um / a- I mean, in -/ not all in one sitting./ but I think I read the whole thing./ at different times./ different sections./
6 T/H:INTERACTIVE  um / yes./ mm./ because I mean, some of the things I did well on./ and some things I did poorly on, and it just sort of balanced out./ fair is in the middle./
7 LD/E:MUSICAL  that was poor./ yes./ <LG> um / well, maybe I know about things, um./ but in this test I couldn't do very well./ so./ like, we were talking about composers, but um, I wasn't ak- asked about composers./ so./ I can remember, like, information about music./ but I was asked to sing songs, and I couldn't remember the lyrics./ yeah./ that's what I said./ yeah, but they're two different skills./ you know, reading and speaking, sort of./ you know./ um / yeah, I think it could bring doubt into their mind, but um./ I mean, there's a reason why not all musicians are are singers./ they -/ you know, it's very specialized./ so, just because you can,  you know, read something off a page, I don't know./ it's not a predictor of b- abiltity./ right./ that's what I said./ yeah./ I mean, I don't know<MP> that I've sung in front of people./ um / so / they probably wouldn't know how how I sing./ that was poor./ yes./ <LG>
8 LU/HE:SURVIVAL  <OTP> oh./ <LG> </OTP> um / let's see./ why would that be?/ like, where did you have -/ I don't know./ I'm not supposed to ask the questions, but./ um / like, yeah./ well you might be a little confused because, I mean, I was able to answer all the questions./ I mean<MP>, not all of them, but almost all of them very well./ and um./ but I don't I don't have much practical knowledge./ so but, I don't know./ somehow I did very well./ um / naturally there's a chance./ but um / um / partly <LG>./ um / well, no./ I mean, I I'm, like, very close to the, uh, um / <SN> to the, uh, example I'm supposed to follow./ so: / it's not -/ I'm really not exaggerating./ um / I would say an eight./ no, I wouldn't./ um / because I I mean, I don't know how I'd be in a situation where there's, like, a lot of, like, panic and noise, and, you know./ and the conditions are different./ so./ you know, the things I know I might not be able to -/ I might be so um, overwhelmed that I that I couldn't, um./ um / I couldn't save somebody./ <UNIN> couldn't offer my help./ but when you're just talking about it, you know, everything seems to be pretty much um / you know, it's obvious what you should do./ in some situations./
9 T/E:FOODWINE   um / good./ yes./ um / because I: made an effort at one point in my life to learn certain skills./ and / um / even though I don't have much chance<MP> to use them that often um, they're things that you that you: -/ that stick with you./
10 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  <LG> um / yeah. I mean, I could agree that, but um, the type of things I was asked was, like, you know, what -/ between -/ exactly between what streets and what streets something is./ and: / numbered streets I couldn't remember exactly the numbers./ um / I mean, I was in the I was in the range but um / um / certain things were farther, much farther east than I think because I forget that Broadway is, like, well, -/ I know it goes uh -/ but I don't remember what t- what at what intersections it crosses which avenues./ and, like, sometimes I just get, like a name of something that's in my mind./ and I cou- I could only remember the first letter of the street so / I would forget./ I would be like I know it starts with a C./ I can see it spelled out./ but um / but I couldn't remember the name./ of like the island./ or the tunnel./ so that's why I didn't score very well./ um / I guess because I said I like to, like, take people around town and I must know where things are./ um / like./ yeah./ I mean, I know it's um / it seems like contradictory./ but uh /
11 LU/H:CIVICS  oh./ but I'm not./ um / like, I know pretty well the things that I was asked there./ and uh / like, because I take an interest in local and um current affairs./ it was pretty easy./ um / I guess./ um / when well, when the assignment was to lie./ or um / yeah, I don't see what it would do much good to lie./ um, in any other circumstance./ yeah, about ques- about questions like this./ <LN> um / well, yeah, there's a chance./ but / um / well, I only needed to tell a couple of lies./ but on the whole you can be <UNIN> sure that what I've said is true./ um, you know, with a l- few hedging. I mean, with a little bit of hedging./ no./ that's not possible./ on my knowledge of civics./ I would say that I am a nine./ um / well, there's always something more you can learn./ there's just an awful lot of information./ and it's impossible to keep on top of everything./ in particular, the type of questions I was asked./ involved, like, people./ the names of people who have held offices for only a few years, so you have to really keep on top of that./ it was excellent./ of course./ <LG>
