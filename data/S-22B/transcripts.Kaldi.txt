0 T/H:INTERACTIVE  um  um  i mean some things where  and  really hard to <unk> things were okay so  sort of balanced out  it was fair  um  well like i said um  something they did really well on  and  something  i  couldn't do it all  and uh  [noise] so  i think about that [laughter]  um  and  coordination  yeah  but um  action following  and  somewhat  um  let's see  i guess i i don't play any group sports  do you exercise  yeah  [laughter]  um yes  i played tennis  i guess that's a good sport [laughter]  oh  um  fair [laughter]  i mean  i'd never i never i kept it up for a long enough to ah  <unk> right  um  i  yeah i think so  um  i think  they would  they would expect that score  um  yeah i think that would be what would what would be expected  it'd be  or that person would say [laughter]  um  yeah  no i don't [laughter]  um  yeah that i don't know  i don't know maybe not  um  they they don't really think of me as being coordinated  um  so um  so actually  i  i probably did better on this test than expected than other people would have expected from me  as far as coordination  it was  it was fair 
1 LD/E:MUSICAL  um  well  most of the songs um that i was asked to sing or  children songs and  i had forgotten the words you most of them  and uh  i can't really carry a teen  i used to play the piano  um  as a child  but not right now  mhm  uh they probably wouldn't think of me as a singer  uh-huh  uh-huh  like i said i  i don't have much of a thing  mhm  what's that  um  uh-huh mhm  public  probably  you know in a group seeing happy birthday about  i don't know last year  <unk>  um yes  um  well  mostly pop music yes  yeah  i just listen to the radio  hum  i don't like control like really when i'm listening to so [laughter]  um  if it was  i mean i really like  yeah um  like being able to read music  and huh  just here  in general  nope  um [noise]  probably in uh  tenth grade  yeah  uh not really  mhm  hum  but see it's hard to remember it um  because  i mean it paid a lot of a lot of  songs that you wouldn't  [noise] normally listen to i mean they're just exercises  so you don't remember that composer really no  great classics  um  because  um i guess i remember playing  things by  uh-huh  they were pretty simple by shoe mind  uh hardly ever  i think so  yes  yes  uh no i don't 
2 LU/HE:SURVIVAL  okay mhm  i did very well  oh it was excellent  um  well i like to read  i read this one book about ah  interesting like um  well  yeah just basically survival um  tools in in like all all different parts of the world  but  also i um  have you some of the things i was asked about in real life  like  and uh  in going skiing  so i knew that from first hand experience  um when it when they're different  things you need to know  yeah  and um  i mean some of it i think he's just based on commonsense  so  so that part wasn't that hard  um  well  uh the one was  um how to what to do when  someone it's bitten by snake  and you're off in the woods  [noise] so  um  basically  you should cut off the uh  you should try to you should you little uh  mhm  um this little section device to try to bring that that amount  and use the pressure and and you know  and that seems to be based on commonsense  but uh  i've actually had  experience not oh within the larger group  so i would not like directly responsible for  but i  uh with <unk> with a bunch of people or something was bitten by i think  so  um  oh that would not want to <unk> i thought it was just a common sense thing  uh-huh  yeah i  like when i was in california  i had more experience with outdoors and um different types of  environment then you find here in the city so  that's why i think some of these things should be like  yeah self explanatory  mhm  um  well testing the um  i mean  the uh  um  actually none of the uh  the things i was asking about  like directly  um  like i use directly with skiing but um  like knowing how to  um  how to like  the best thing to do sometimes when you  when you fall in <unk> on ice  is  you know  use the ice tea too  hum  mhm  she stopped swelling and it's sometimes the best place to be is if you if you say breaking you are  neck or something i find  and  yeah that was one of the questions  a severe break  whether you know he'd or ice it's best  in that situation you're surrounded by  ice  so  you know just waiting for health is  it's not so bad  um yes i  right <unk> um  c._p._r.  i'd glass  um  not  mhm  not  the type of skills that i learnt there now  that's just uh you know mouth to mouth and  um because of the nation  um  it depends not not  entirely comfortable um  because  [laughter]  i feel like i knew a lot of things  in my head  but  um  but because i have <unk> limited experience  um  i guess  and  uh i haven't put thing and to practice  that often  and  that would make me a little nervous at first  mhm that's your best friend  um  test that survival skills  um  they would probably say  that  um  that i would do well  um  because people know  that  mhm  um  well i talk about these things sometimes to people so  they've heard me  um just using like  yeah  talking about different situations  without being without having been in them  but  yes  they would think i  that i know  to do 
3 T/E:FOODWINE  okay  i did  like  i'm good  just didn't know  yeah it was good  um i think because  hi  it's not it's uh  not just automatic skills that you  you pick up  you have to learn these things  and i  paid attention  um  i made myself learn  a few  dining the skills  yeah  no  not that often  um  i would  see  yes  yeah  um  not really  um  the kind of food that i  um i'm exposed to now  i would say we definitely  eight different things and prepared them differently and  um  yeah  did things a lot differently when i was growing up  but um  it was still  pretty important  um  well  um  i guess  and  it's very hard to say  hum  well see things that are made well i know i could say most of the things that are made with uh  really fresh  mhm  um  probably from my  mhm  from  um  it's very difficult question  um  probably from my ah sister's  because i think we learn  a lot of the same things at the same time  and  yeah  and we're able to experiment with things  too  uh no i don't  no i really don't see them very often  yes it is  um  i think they would say  that  that i would do really well  um probably once a week  um  um [laughter]  and all that much [noise] yes i would say i cook  um  every day  yeah  that's pretty much 
4 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  um  see  oh  hum  didn't do very well  uh-huh  poorly  um eight years  that was in uh  nineteen ninety six  um  well i guess  you you go places  but you don't  really  i mean you can walk there  you can  you can  tell somebody how to get there  but you don't really remember what street they're on  and  particular i would ask questions where  between what in what street  you know generally how to get there  sort of midtown  but  you don't remember the actual street  and  i can remember seeing  i can remember a lot of times  what letter things start with  but  i can't remember the name of the whole whole name of landmarks  like an h  yeah  yeah  like the names for um tunnels  yeah  i live in brooklyn  um two years  in manhattan  um  let's see  um  i think you know manhattan  um  probably my  my neighborhood  right  in brooklyn  um fort green  um i like to stay in brooklyn  like  the neighborhoods like around um  mhm  i'm carol garden  <unk> so  or green whatever  yeah 'cause here kitty  yeah  closer to home  um  yeah every once in a while  um oh  [noise] um  well i like  you take <unk> to the end  and  um on the staten island ferry  and  and i take them to  uh-huh  um [noise]  i like steak them up where they have a nice view  it's a nice day  and  like the occupation tyrant empire state building  and  um  like to take them to coney island  and  central park  mostly  you know  large  landmarks rather than  uh-huh  other than other things  um  well for people to come there  um  it's very important because those are the things that  they know about already  so you have to do then  you can go from there  time  okay  mhm  mhm  mhm  yeah 
5 LU/H:CIVICS  very well  excellent  well um  like i'm a history major  and  you just have to know what's going on right now  so i read  paper regularly  and  um i took a couple of classes in political science  so  um  like you just have to keep um be aware of what these uh governmental positions are  things like that  um what school  um hunter  um  yes  um  uh-huh  but  i  um  but i don't think i want to um go into that um  like as  you know any further like  i guess as far as um in school  yes  so  um i think that  that um  she wouldn't be surprised at all  that she would expect that  um  probably not as well as i did  yes  seems like  i'm always asking questions of evil  and  if i'm asking questions in probably i don't know the answer  but i think because  we're talking about these things a lot of time  you know it's been  i guess these peace this information it's like they're  um  i read  the um  new york times  and  uh  new york review of books  and  mhm  uh-huh  new york observer  um  yes i think so  i mean  not  um  oh yes they are [laughter]  yes  um  the last being like a very like um  well i'll let you in  or  um  well i can say the last election that took place  i voted here  nice  november what was it  but i think there was an election since then  that was just  um like  city  something  and that i didn't vote that  mhm  [laughter]  oh yes i do  um yes they do  um  i guess  mhm  'cause i'll start conversations about  yeah  different  um  different things that are current  yeah  things that are before the uh  to be in court  or  that  are  but then it would be considering  before they go into law or before they make decisions  oh i like to keep aware of that  um  yes  that's right  um  um  mhm  [noise]  should i elaborate  uh-huh  and the constitution  um i mean and not all in one city  but  i think i read  the whole thing  different times  different sections 
6 T/H:INTERACTIVE  um  yes  mhm  because  i mean some things i  dwell on  and some things i did  really on and it sort of balanced out  ferris in the middle 
7 LD/E:MUSICAL  that was poor  yes  [laughter]  um  well maybe i know about things  um  but in this test  i couldn't do it very well so  like we are talking about composure but  i wasn't i asked about composers  so i can remember like information about music  but i would have to  songs and  i couldn't remember the lyrics  yeah that's what i said  yeah but they're two different skills  you know reading  and speaking tours  mhm  um  yeah i think it could bring down into their mind but  um i mean there's a reason why  not all musicians are  our singers  right  you know it's very specialized  so just because you can  you know  read something off page  no it's not predict or a bit civility  right that's what i said  yeah  i mean i don't  no that i've sung in front of people  um so  they probably wouldn't know how  how exciting  that was poor  yeah [laughter] 
8 LU/HE:SURVIVAL  mhm  um  let's see why would happy [laughter]  like where did you have i don't know enough about the questions but  um  right  yeah  oh you might be a little confused because i mean  i was able to answer all the questions  i mean not all of them but  almost all of them  very well  and  um  but i don't i don't have much practical knowledge  [noise] so  but i don't know somehow i did  very well  um actually is a chance  but  um  um  partly [laughter]  um  well no i mean i  i'm like very close to the uh  um  mhm  to the ah example i spoke to <unk>  so  it's not  i'm really not  exaggerating  um  i would see  and eat  no i wouldn't  um  because i  i mean i don't know how i'd be in a situation where there's like a lot of like panicking noise and you know  and the conditions are different  so  you know the things i know i might not be able to to meet you too  um overwhelmed  that i that i couldn't um  um  i couldn't save somebody  well see now for my help  but when you're talking about it you know everything seems to be pretty much  um  obviously you should do in some situations 
9 T/E:FOODWINE  hum  good  yes  um  because  i made an effort at one point in my life to learn certain skills and  um  even though i don't have  much chance to use them  that often  um there are things that you  you  stick with you 
10 LD/E:NYCGEOGRAPHY  [laughter]  um yeah i mean i can agree that but  um that type of thing that i would ask  was like you know  between  between what streets and what streets something  yes  and  numbered streets i couldn't remember exactly the numbers  um i mean i was in i was in the range  but um  um certain things or further much further east and i think because  i forget the broadway  like well  i know it goes  um but i don't remember what the what what intersections it crosses [noise]  yeah  avenues  and like sometimes i just get like a name something that's in my mind and i can i can only remember the first letter of the street  so  i would forget that would be like a new with her to the sea  i can see it's spelled out  but  um  i can remember the name  of like  the island  but  tunnel  so that's why i didn't score very well  um  i guess  because i said i like to like pay people around town  and i must not where things are  um  like yeah i mean i know it's  and  it seems like  contradictory  but uh 
11 LU/H:CIVICS  oh but i'm not [laughter]  um  like i know pretty well like the things that i would ask there  and uh  see if they take an interest in  oh cool  and um  current affairs  it was pretty easy  um  i guess  and  when  well when the assignment  well that's a lie  or  um  yeah i don't see what it would be much good to lie  um in any other sure yeah  yeah about about questions like this  mhm  um  well yeah there's a chance  but  um  well i only need you tell a couple of lies  but  on the whole  you can be pretty sure that  right that is true  um you know with a <unk> few heading  i mean  it's a little bit of hiking  that's not possible  my knowledge it sticks  i would see  i am a nine  um well there's always something more you can learn stairs  just an awful lot of  information  it's impossible to keep on top of everything  particular type of questions that was asked  involved like  people the names of people who have  held offices for  only a few years so you have to really keep on top of that  it was excellent  of course  [laughter]
